# Quick Start: Playing in The Western Horizon

## What Makes This Different

### You Drive the Story
**Traditional D&D:** GM creates hooks → You choose → GM runs prepared content  
**Western Horizon:** You declare goals → GM creates obstacles → Story emerges

**What this means:** Come to the table (or planning chat) knowing what your character wants. If you don't have goals, the campaign feels directionless—not because content is missing, but because content generation waits for YOUR direction.

### Open Table Scheduling
1. Player posts: "I want to [goal]. Who's in? Need DM for [date/time]"
2. Others sign up (or don't—no guilt!)
3. A DM claims it
4. That group plays

**No fixed party. No required attendance. No "main story" you'll miss.**

### Living World
Discoveries become permanent canon. What one group establishes, all groups respect. Your character knows what's in the Guild archives (the wiki). The world continues whether you're playing or not.

## Your Primary Job: Maintain Three Goals

Each character needs goals at any time. These drive everything.

| Goal Type | Time Horizon | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Short-term** | 1-3 sessions | "Find moss in Thornwood for alchemist" |
| **Medium-term** | 3-10 sessions | "Discover who's behind the disappearances" |
| **Long-term** | Campaign arc | "Restore my family's honor" |

### Goal Quality Checklist
✓ **Player-authored** — YOU invented it  
✓ **Specific endpoint** — "Win tournament" not "get stronger"  
✓ **Clear consequences** — You know what failure costs  
✓ **Non-repeatable** — Can't just try again  
✓ **Fun to pursue** — You can imagine obstacles  
✓ **Connected to character** — Relates to who they are

**Bad goal:** "Become more powerful to protect people" (vague, repeatable, generic)  
**Good goal:** "Win Grand Tournament so Su-Li will marry me, but if I lose, her family betroths her to Lord Ravencroft" (specific, consequential, non-repeatable, connected)

## Character Creation: Goals First, Stats Second

### The Process
1. **Generate Your Goals** — What do you want to accomplish?
2. **Design Character Backward** — What class/background fits someone pursuing these goals?
3. **Fill Character Form** — Capture personality, approaches, NPCs, etc.
4. **Connect to World** — Which factions care? What locations matter?

**Traditional:** Pick class → invent personality → find motivation  
**Western Horizon:** Envision goals → design character who'd pursue them → select mechanics that fit

### The Magic Question
For each goal, ask: **"What would it look like when I reach this goal?"**

Envision the scene:
- Where are you?
- Who's there?
- What just happened?
- How do you feel?

This vision helps create specific, achievable endpoints.

## The Rhythm of Play

### Between Sessions
**Planning Phase:**
- Post intent or join someone else's expedition
- Coordinate schedule in Discord/chat
- First 3-5 interested players get slots

**GM Prep Phase:**
- DM generates content responsive to your declared goal
- Simple expeditions: 1-2 days prep
- Complex generation: 3-5 days prep

**Wiki Reference Phase:**
- Skim relevant pages (5-10 min before session)
- Know what's already been discovered
- Build on existing canon

### During Sessions
**You start already committed** — No "will you take the hook?" You declared intent days ago. Session opens in medias res.

**Your actions drive the scene** — Don't wait for DM to offer options. Declare what you do. GM adjudicates whether it works.

**Examples of proactive play:**
- "I intimidate the guard by claiming I work for the Merchant's Guild"
- "Can I use my architecture knowledge to spot structural weaknesses?"
- "I befriend the barmaid to learn local politics"
- "I climb the tree for a better vantage"

**Failures create opportunities** — Failed roll = something interesting happens, not "you're bad at this game"

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### "I don't know what my character wants"
**Solution:**
1. Review your three goals—specific enough?
2. Ask in chat: "My character wants X. What would that look like?"
3. Check bulletin board for faction activity
4. Attach to another player's goal
5. Create new character if current one isn't inspiring

### "I'm waiting for the right moment"
**Solution:** Just do it. There's no "right moment." If you want to examine something, examine it. Your actions ARE the sequence.

### "I don't want to step on the DM's toes"
**Solution:** DM has no plans to ruin. They have obstacles, not storylines. Being proactive makes their job easier, not harder.

**Reframe:** "Will the DM be annoyed if I..." → "The DM wants me to..."

### "Other players do all the cool stuff"
**Solution:**
1. Make your goals as compelling as theirs
2. Find intersection points to pursue together
3. Post your own expeditions instead of only joining
4. Talk to DM about spotlight balance

## Five Adjustments for Open Table Play

1. **Missing sessions is normal** — No guilt, no excuses. Just show up when you can.

2. **Party composition varies** — You won't always play with the same people. That's expected.

3. **You control engagement level** — Play every week or once a month. Both work.

4. **World persists without you** — Factions advance, players discover, the world changes. It's a feature.

5. **Canon is sacred** — What one group establishes is permanent. Build on it, don't retcon it.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Think about goals** — What would you want to pursue?
2. **Attend Session Zero** — Help build the world collaboratively
3. **Create your character** — Goals first, mechanics second
4. **Post expedition intent** — Or join someone else's
5. **Play** — And discover what emerges

**Questions?** Post in Discord. The table benefits from clarity.

**Welcome to The Western Horizon. Your goals become the story.**
