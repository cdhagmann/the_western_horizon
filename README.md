# The Western Horizon

*A Design Philosophy for Collaborative West Marches Campaigns*

---

**The Western Horizon** is a design philosophy and campaign framework where players drive the story through their goals, the GM generates content responsively, and the world is built collaboratively.

Unlike traditional West Marches (where the GM pre-builds an entire world), WH generates content **when players declare where they're going and why**. Unlike traditional campaigns (where the GM plans storylines), WH lets **stories emerge from player goals colliding with faction goals**.

## 🎯 What Is This?

**The Western Horizon defines:**
- **Problems** that need solving at each scale (history, settlement, wilderness, dungeon)
- **What makes a good solution** (collaborative, responsive, creates factions with goals)
- **Proven examples** of systems that work
- **Workflows** from player intent → content generation → session play → wiki documentation

**It is not:**
- A collection of mandatory systems
- A rigid playbook
- A replacement for your TTRPG rules

Think of WH as **architecture** that shows how pieces fit together, not the pieces themselves.

## 🧭 Core Philosophy: Five Pillars

1. **Goal-Driven Play** — Players bring goals, not reactions to GM hooks
2. **Responsive Generation** — Content created when needed (between sessions), not before
3. **Collaborative Authorship** — GM as referee and co-author, not primary storyteller
4. **Canon Integration** — Generated content becomes permanent shared knowledge
5. **Scale & Scope** — Different procedures for different scales (settlement ≠ location ≠ dungeon)

### Self-Contained Expeditions

WH sessions follow a different structure than traditional play:

| Phase | What Happens | GM Role |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Planning** | Players declare destination and goal | Prep that location |
| **Expedition** | Players execute declared plan | Adjudicate actions |
| **Resolution** | Return, log discoveries, advance clocks | Simulate world changes |

You're never surprised about *where* they're going—only *what they do* when they get there.

## 📚 Proven Solutions

The framework presents **battle-tested systems** that align with WH principles:

| Problem Domain | Example Systems |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **Play Structure** | Proactive Roleplaying |
| **History & Culture** | Microscope, Chronicle |
| **Living Settlements** | Ex Novo, Kingdom |
| **Detailed Locations** | Beak Feather & Bone, Street Magic |
| **Wilderness Travel** | Perilous Wilds, Hexmancer |
| **Dangerous Sites** | Ex Umbra, RISE |

**These are examples, not requirements.** Use what works for your table. The design language works whether you roll randomly or choose deliberately.
