# The Western Horizon

*A Framework for Collaborative West Marches Campaigns*

---

**The Western Horizon** is a unified campaign framework that combines collaborative worldbuilding games with traditional West Marches play. Instead of pre-generating a world before play begins, content is created *responsively*—when a player says "I want to explore the swamp to the northwest," that's when the swamp gets built.

Once established, all generated content "always existed" as common knowledge available to every guild member.

## 🎯 What Is This?

This framework provides procedures for:

- **Session Zero** — Establishing tone, boundaries, and the campaign's starting conditions
- **Settlement Creation** — Building towns and cities using collaborative games
- **Wilderness Generation** — Populating hexes with terrain, discoveries, and dangers
- **Dungeon Design** — Creating adventure sites from rumors and hearsay
- **Quest Preparation** — Turning player intent into session-ready content
- **The Guild Archive** — Maintaining a living wiki of campaign canon

## 📚 Source Systems

The Western Horizon synthesizes procedures from these excellent games:

| System | Author | Used For |
