# Player Expectations & Character Creation
## Draft for The Western Horizon

---

## SECTION PLACEMENT
This should become a new section between Session Zero and Settlements:
- Current: Session Zero → Settlements
- Proposed: Session Zero → **Player Guide** → Settlements

This gives players clear expectations before their first adventure and integrates goal-driven character creation into the workflow.

---

## CONTENT STRUCTURE

### Main Section: "Player's Guide to the Western Horizon"
Should be in `_includes/01a-player-guide.html`

#### Subsections:
1. **What Makes This Different** - The shift from reactive to proactive play
2. **Your Role as a Player** - Expectations and opportunities
3. **Creating Your Character** - Goals-first character design
4. **Between Sessions** - How the open table works
5. **During Expeditions** - What to expect in play

---

## DRAFT CONTENT

### What Makes This Different

If you've played D&D or other TTRPGs before, this campaign works differently in some important ways. Understanding these differences will help you get the most out of play.

#### The Inversion: You Drive, We React

**Traditional Play:**
- GM creates hooks → Players choose → GM runs prepared content
- "What do you want to do?" often means "which of my planned options do you pick?"
- Story comes to you through GM-authored plot

**Western Horizon Play:**
- Players declare goals → GM creates obstacles → Players pursue goals
- "What do you want to do?" means exactly what it says
- Story emerges from your goals colliding with faction goals

This isn't just a philosophical difference—it changes how you approach play:

| Traditional Expectation | Western Horizon Reality |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Wait for hooks to appear | Bring goals to the table |
| React to GM's story | Author your character's story |
| Guess what the GM wants | Say what you want |
| Choose between options | Create your own options |
| Adventure finds you | You find adventure |

**What this means in practice:**

You need to arrive at the table (or in the planning chat) with answers to: "What does my character want right now?" If you don't know what you want, the campaign will feel directionless—not because the GM isn't providing content, but because the content generation waits for your direction.

**This is liberating, not limiting.** You're not guessing what the GM prepped. You're not constrained to "obvious" choices. If you want to find the assassin who killed your mentor, investigate the corruption in the merchant's guild, or establish a trade route with the nomads—say so. That's what generates content.

#### The Open Table: Show Up When You Want

**How scheduling works:**
1. Player posts: "I want to [goal]. Who's in? Need a DM for [date/time]."
2. Other players sign up (or don't—no guilt)
3. A DM claims it
4. That group plays that session

**What this means:**
- No fixed party composition
- No expectation you'll attend every session
- No "main storyline" that requires continuity
- Multiple groups can play simultaneously in the same world

**Your character between sessions:**
Between expeditions, your character is at the Guild. They're training, researching, networking, resting. When you can't make a session, your character simply wasn't on that expedition. No explanation needed.

**Playing with different groups:**
You might join one expedition to the swamps with Alice, Bob, and Carol, then the next week explore ruins with David, Emily, and Frank. This is normal and expected. The world is persistent, but parties are flexible.

#### The Living World: It Always Existed

When you discover something—a ruined temple, a merchant prince, a hidden faction—it becomes **permanent canon**. It gets logged in the Guild wiki as something "the Guild always knew about" (even though we just created it).

**What this means:**
- You can reference discoveries from other groups' sessions
- NPCs remember past interactions (even with different players)
- The world grows session by session
- Your actions have lasting consequences

**Example:**
The Azure Company cleared the bandit camp last month. Your character knows this (it's in the Guild archives). When you go to that hex, you'll find whatever they left behind, encounter consequences of their actions, or discover what moved in after.

#### Collaborative Creation: We Build Together

You're not just consuming content the GM created. At multiple points, you'll participate in worldbuilding:

- **Session Zero:** Everyone builds history and the starting settlement together
- **Settlement Building:** When reaching new tiers, we play collaborative games to create towns
- **Rumor Tables:** Your speculation about dungeons influences what's actually there
- **Discovery:** When you find something new, you help name it and describe it

This isn't "helping the GM prep." This is **playing a different kind of game**—worldbuilding games are fun in their own right and give you ownership of the world.

---

### Your Role as a Player

#### Primary Responsibility: Bring Goals

The most important thing you do as a player is **maintain goals for your character**. Without player goals, the campaign has no direction. With them, everything flows naturally.

**The three-goal framework:**
Each character should have three goals at any given time:

| Goal Type | Time Horizon | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Short-term** | 1-3 sessions | "Find the moss in the Thornwood for the alchemist" |
| **Medium-term** | 3-10 sessions | "Discover who's behind the disappearances" |
| **Long-term** | Campaign arc | "Restore my family's honor and reclaim our ancestral estate" |

As you complete goals, you create new ones. This is a continuous process, not just a Session Zero activity.

#### Secondary Responsibilities

**Communicate Your Intent**
- Post in the group chat when you want to play
- Say what goal you're pursuing
- Coordinate with other players
- Claim a session or join one someone else posted

**Respect the Canon**
- What's established is real and persistent
- Don't contradict what's in the wiki
- Build on discoveries, don't ignore them
- Update the wiki with your discoveries (or work with the DM to do so)

**Be Proactive in Play**
- Don't wait for the DM to offer options
- Declare actions confidently
- Ask for what you need
- Use creative solutions

**Participate in Building (Optional but Fun)**
- Join worldbuilding sessions when available
- These are optional but rewarding
- It's still gaming, just a different kind

#### What's NOT Expected

**You don't need to:**
- Attend every session
- Always have a plan
- Play the "right" character type
- Maintain party composition
- Wait for the DM to tell you what to do
- Know everything in the wiki
- Figure out the "correct" solution

---

### Creating Your Character

Character creation in The Western Horizon starts with goals, not stats. Design your character around what they want, not just what they can do.

#### Step 1: Generate Your Goals

Before you open the Player's Handbook, answer these questions:

**For your short-term goal:**
- What can my character accomplish in 1-3 sessions?
- What would be a satisfying immediate victory?
- What would failing this goal cost me?

**For your medium-term goal:**
- What am I building toward over multiple sessions?
- How does this connect to the world we're creating?
- Who might oppose this goal?

**For your long-term goal:**
- What would allow my character to retire satisfied?
- How does this tie to my character's core identity?
- What would make pursuing this goal fun for years?

**The Magic Question:** For each goal, ask yourself: *"What would it look like when I reach this goal?"*

This isn't about mechanics. Envision the scene:
- Where are you?
- Who's there?
- What just happened?
- How do you feel?

This vision helps you and the DM create specific, achievable endpoints.

#### Goal Quality Checklist

Good goals have these properties:

- [ ] **Player-authored** — YOU invented it (not suggested by the DM)
- [ ] **Specific endpoint** — "Win the tournament" not "get stronger"
- [ ] **Clear consequences** — You know what happens if you fail
- [ ] **Non-repeatable** — Can't just try again next week
- [ ] **Fun to pursue** — You can imagine interesting obstacles
- [ ] **Connected to character** — Relates to who they are

**Bad goal example:**
"I want to become more powerful so I can protect people."

Why it's bad:
- Vague endpoint (when are you "powerful enough"?)
- No specific consequences for failure
- Repeatable (just keep leveling)
- Generic (could apply to any character)

**Good goal example:**
"I want to win the Grand Tournament in Songul so Su-Li will agree to marry me, but if I lose, her family will betroth her to Lord Ravencroft instead."

Why it's good:
- Specific endpoint (win the tournament)
- Clear consequences (Su-Li marries someone else if you fail)
- Non-repeatable (the tournament happens once; if you lose, the moment passes)
- Fun to pursue (training montages, rivals, political intrigue)
- Connected to character (reveals who they love and what they'll risk)

#### Step 2: Design Your Character Backward

Now that you have goals, design a character who would reasonably pursue them.

**Questions to answer:**
- What class/abilities would help me pursue these goals?
- What background explains why I care about these goals?
- What relationships do I have that connect to these goals?
- What personality traits drive me toward these goals?

This is the *opposite* of traditional character creation:
- **Traditional:** Pick class → invent personality → find motivation
- **Western Horizon:** Envision goals → design character who'd pursue them → select mechanics that fit

**Example:**

You start with the goal about Su-Li and the tournament. Working backward:
- **Class:** Fighter (tournament combat specialist) or Bard (win through charm and trickery)
- **Background:** Noble (involved in tournament culture) or Folk Hero (the underdog story)
- **Personality:** Determined, romantic, perhaps overconfident
- **Flaw:** "I can't resist a challenge to my honor"
- **Bonds:** Su-Li (obviously), a mentor who's training me, perhaps a rival

The mechanics *serve* the goals, not the other way around.

#### Step 3: Fill Out the Character Creation Form

Now use the Character Creation Form to capture all this:

**Campaign Concept Section:**
- Explain how your character fits the campaign's framing
- Reference the world we built in Session Zero
- Show how your goals connect to established factions/locations

**Quick Character Sketch:**
- **High concept:** One-sentence summary ("Disgraced knight seeking redemption through the tournament")
- **Previous life:** What they did before becoming an adventurer
- **Destiny/Bond:** Why they adventure (maps to your long-term goal)
- **Aspects/Traits:** How a narrator would describe them
- **Ideal:** Your guiding principle
- **Trouble/Flaw:** What causes problems
- **Tragedy:** The event that pushed them to adventure

**Character Approach:**
Pick two ways you solve problems:
- Careful (observe and plan)
- Clever (think and improvise)
- Flashy (charm and perform)
- Forceful (fight and intimidate)
- Quick (act and react)
- Sneaky (hide and infiltrate)

These describe your *preferred methods*, not just your character class.

**Character Virtue & Alignment:**
These track your character's moral journey. Check where you are *now* and underline where you *hope to be* by campaign end. This isn't just flavor—it's another kind of goal (character growth rather than external achievement).

**NPCs to Establish:**
List NPCs the DM needs to know about:
- Su-Li (the love interest)
- Lord Ravencroft (the rival for Su-Li's hand)
- Mentor Blackwood (tournament trainer)
- Su-Li's father (who disapproves)

Name them all, even if just nicknames. These become part of the world.

**Fear/Hate Buttons:**
Things that make your character act irrationally:
- "Lord Ravencroft—I can't think straight when he mocks me"
- "Heights—my mentor died falling from scaffolding"

These create dramatic moments, not just handicaps.

#### Step 4: Connect Goals to the World

Your goals should intersect with:
- Factions we created in Session Zero
- Locations established collaboratively
- Other players' characters (where possible)
- The Guild's purpose and resources

**During character creation, ask:**
- Which faction cares about my goals (positively or negatively)?
- Which locations would I need to visit?
- Do any other PCs have overlapping goals?
- How does the Guild help or hinder me?

This integration ensures your goals will naturally create interesting play.

#### Example: Complete Character Creation

**Step 1 - Goals:**
- Short-term: "Win the first qualifier tournament in Foxborough to prove I'm worthy"
- Medium-term: "Uncover Lord Ravencroft's cheating in past tournaments"
- Long-term: "Win the Grand Tournament and marry Su-Li"

**Step 2 - Character Design:**
- Class: Fighter (Battlemaster)
- Background: Noble (fallen family, trying to restore honor)
- Name: Marcus Ashford
- Personality: Honorable to a fault, romantic, can't resist challenges

**Step 3 - Form Details:**
- High concept: "Disgraced noble seeking redemption through tournament glory"
- Previous life: "Trained in the family's martial tradition before our lands were seized"
- Destiny: "Restore my family's honor and prove Su-Li's father wrong about my worth"
- Trouble: "I cannot walk away from a challenge, even when I should"
- Tragedy: "Watched my father lose everything through one political misstep"
- NPCs: Su-Li (love interest), Lord Ravencroft (rival), Master Kai (tournament trainer), Duke Chen (Su-Li's father)

**Step 4 - World Connection:**
- The Merchant's Guild (faction) sponsors the tournament
- Lord Ravencroft is heir to the Trading Consortium (faction conflict!)
- Foxborough (location) hosts the qualifiers
- The capital Songul (location) hosts the Grand Tournament
- Another PC is also entering the tournament (built-in party connection)

Now you have a complete character whose goals naturally drive engagement with the world.

### Between Sessions: The Rhythm of Play

The Western Horizon has a specific rhythm that's different from traditional campaigns.

#### The Planning Phase

**This happens in Discord/your communication platform:**

1. **Someone Posts Intent**
   - "I want to investigate those ruins we heard about. Looking for the Ember Stone. Who's in?"
   - "Need 3-4 players. Thinking [day/time]."

2. **Others Respond**
   - "I'm in—my character needs information about ancient magic"
   - "Can't make it this week, have fun!"
   - "I'm interested if you shift to [different day]"

3. **A DM Claims It**
   - "I'll run this. Give me 2-3 days to prep."
   - DM coordinates with the requesting player about expectations

4. **Party Forms**
   - First 3-5 interested players get slots
   - Party doesn't need to be "balanced"—this is exploration, not a video game

**Your role:**
- Post when you want to play
- Join posts that interest your character
- Communicate schedule clearly
- Be flexible about party composition

**What if no one posts?**
- Check the bulletin board for faction activity
- Coordinate with other players about shared goals
- Ask in chat: "Anyone interested in [general activity]?"
- Remember: You can't wait for the DM to tell you what to do

#### The GM Prep Phase

**This happens between when the DM claims a session and when you play:**

The DM uses the generation systems to create content responsive to your declared goal:
- If you're going somewhere new, they generate that location
- If you're pursuing a goal, they create obstacles
- If you're investigating something, they determine what's knowable

**Your role:**
- Answer any questions the DM has
- Provide context about your goal if needed
- Don't backseat-DM ("you should include...")
- Trust the generation systems

**How much time does the DM need?**
- For simple expeditions (revisiting known locations): 1-2 days
- For complex generation (new dungeons, major sites): 3-5 days
- For significant world additions (new settlements): Might need a building session first

**This is why open table scheduling works:** The DM preps *after* they know what you want, not *before* hoping you'll bite on hooks.

#### The Wiki Reference Phase

**Before your session, you should:**

Check the Guild Wiki for:
- What's already known about your destination
- Relevant faction activities
- NPCs who might be involved
- Previous expedition reports to that area
- Current rumors and bulletin board posts

**You don't need to memorize everything,** but you should know the basics. If you're going to the Thornwood, skim the Thornwood page. If you're dealing with the Merchant's Guild, read their faction page.

**Why this matters:**
- Avoid contradicting established canon
- Build on previous discoveries
- Create continuity between expeditions
- Surprise the DM with clever connections

**How much to read:**
- 5-10 minutes before your session
- Focus on directly relevant pages
- Skim, don't study
- Ask questions in chat if confused

---

### During Expeditions: What to Expect

When your session starts, here's what makes Western Horizon play different:

#### You Start Already Committed

**Traditional campaign opening:**
"You're all in a tavern. A hooded figure approaches..."

**Western Horizon opening:**
"You're three hours into the Thornwood. The path has narrowed, and you can hear running water ahead. What do you do?"

Why the difference? Because you already declared your intent in the planning phase. The DM prepped the Thornwood because you said you were going there. There's no "will you take this hook?" moment—you're already committed.

**This means:**
- Sessions start in medias res
- No "talking in circles at the tavern"
- Every session feels purposeful
- You get to the interesting content faster

#### Your Actions Drive the Scene

**Traditional play:**
"You enter the room. What do you do?"
*(Player hesitates, trying to figure out what the DM wants them to notice)*

**Western Horizon play:**
"You enter the room. What do you do?"
"I examine the altar for inscriptions."
"Great. Give me a History check."

**The difference:**
You're not trying to find the "correct" solution or guess what content the DM prepared. You're declaring actions that make sense for your character's approach and goals. The DM adjudicates whether those actions work.

**Examples of proactive play:**
- "I want to intimidate the guard by telling him I work for the Merchant's Guild"
- "Can I use my knowledge of architecture to spot structural weaknesses?"
- "I'm going to try to befriend the barmaid to learn about local politics"
- "I climb the tree to get a better vantage point"

Notice none of these wait for the DM to offer them as options. You're just *doing things*.

#### Failure Creates Opportunities

When you fail a check or make a bad decision, interesting things happen. The world pushes back. This isn't punishment—it's content generation.

**Traditional mindset:**
"I failed the roll. I'm bad at this game."

**Western Horizon mindset:**
"I failed the roll. Something interesting is about to happen."

Failures advance the story just as much as successes. They create complications, reveal new information, and open unexpected paths. Embrace them.

#### NPCs Have Goals Too

Every significant NPC is part of a faction with goals. When you interact with them, they're not just quest-givers or obstacles—they're pursuing their own objectives.

**What this means:**
- NPCs might help, hinder, or negotiate
- Their goals might overlap or conflict with yours
- You can form genuine alliances
- Betrayals feel earned, not arbitrary

**How to engage with this:**
- Ask NPCs what they want
- Propose mutually beneficial arrangements
- Consider faction politics
- Don't assume everyone is an enemy or ally

#### The World Reacts Between Sessions

When your session ends, the world doesn't freeze. Faction clocks advance. NPCs act on information you revealed. Consequences ripple outward.

**What this means:**
- If you leave a threat unresolved, it might get worse
- If you help a faction, they remember
- Other groups might encounter your consequences
- The world feels alive and responsive

**Example:**
You clear out a bandit camp but don't destroy their supplies. Next time someone goes to that hex, they find the bandits have returned—stronger and more cautious because they know the Guild is hunting them. Another group encounters this, and it's a direct consequence of your choices.

### Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)

#### "I Don't Know What My Character Wants"

**Symptoms:**
- You wait for the GM to offer hooks
- You defer to other players' goals
- Sessions feel directionless for you

**Solution:**
1. Review your three goals—are they specific enough?
2. Ask in chat: "My character wants X. What would that look like?"
3. Use the bulletin board for inspiration
4. Talk to other players—maybe you can attach to their goals
5. Create a new character if the current one isn't inspiring you

**Remember:** You don't need three perfect goals from the start. Start with one decent goal and build from there.

#### "I'm Waiting for the Right Moment"

**Symptoms:**
- You hold back in sessions
- You let other players lead
- You're not sure when to speak up

**Solution:**
Just do it. There's no "right moment" in proactive play. If you want to examine something, examine it. If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. The worst that happens is the DM says "okay, how?" and you figure it out together.

**Western Horizon is forgiving:** There's no "you broke the DM's planned sequence" because there is no planned sequence. Your actions *are* the sequence.

#### "I Don't Want to Step on the DM's Toes"

**Symptoms:**
- You avoid suggesting things
- You ask permission for normal actions
- You're worried about "ruining" the DM's plans

**Solution:**
The DM has no plans for you to ruin. They have obstacles, not storylines. By being proactive, you're not making their job harder—you're making it easier. They want you to declare intent, pursue goals, and take bold actions.

**Reframe it:**
"Will the DM be annoyed if I..." → "The DM wants me to..."

#### "The Other Players Are Doing All the Cool Stuff"

**Symptoms:**
- You feel overshadowed
- Your goals seem less interesting
- You default to support role

**Solution:**
1. Make sure your goals are as compelling as theirs—revise if needed
2. Find intersection points: "Could we pursue both our goals at once?"
3. Post your own session intent instead of only joining others
4. Talk to the DM about spotlight balance

**Remember:** In an open table, sometimes different characters shine in different sessions. That's okay. Your turn will come.

---

### For Players New to Open Tables

If you've never played in a West Marches or open table style before, here are the biggest adjustments:

**1. Missing Sessions Is Normal**
You'll miss sessions. Others will miss sessions you organize. This is expected and fine. Don't feel guilty. Don't make excuses. Just show up when you can and enjoy the fact that the campaign continues whether you're there or not.

**2. Party Composition Varies**
You won't always play with the same group. You might adventure with Alice one week and never see her again for three sessions. You might become regular expedition partners with Bob even though you hardly talk outside sessions. This is normal and creates interesting dynamics.

**3. You Control Your Engagement Level**
Want to play every week? Great—organize expeditions. Want to play once a month? Also great—join when something interests you. Want to take a break for a few months? The campaign will be here when you get back.

**4. The World Persists Without You**
When you're not playing, the world continues. Factions advance their goals. Other players make discoveries. The capital grows. This is a feature, not a bug. You get to return to a world that's changed in interesting ways.

**5. Canon Is Sacred**
What one group establishes, all groups respect. If the Azure Company discovered the temple is guarded by stone sentinels, that's permanent. You don't retcon it, you build on it. This shared continuity is what makes the world feel real.

---

### Next Steps

**After reading this guide:**

1. **Start thinking about goals** — What would you want to pursue?
2. **Attend Session Zero** — Help build the world collaboratively
3. **Create your character** — Goals first, mechanics second
4. **Post your first expedition intent** — Or join someone else's
5. **Play** — And discover what emerges

**Questions? Concerns?**
Post them in the Discord. The whole table benefits from clarity about expectations.

Welcome to The Western Horizon. Your goals become the story.

## INTEGRATION NOTES

### Where This Fits in the Document Flow

**Current structure:**
- Overview → Philosophy → Session Zero → Settlements → ...

**Proposed structure:**
- Overview → Philosophy → Session Zero → **Player Guide** → Settlements → ...

### Why This Position Works

**After Session Zero:**
- Players need this after they understand the collaborative worldbuilding context
- They've participated in creating the world, now they need to create characters *for* that world
- The building blocks (factions, locations) now exist for goals to reference

**Before Settlements:**
- Players understand their role before the first actual expedition
- Character creation with goals happens before play begins
- Expectations are set before potential misunderstandings arise

### File Structure Recommendation

Create `/Users/christopherhagmann/Projects/Personal/the_western_horizon/_includes/01a-player-guide.html`

Create `/Users/christopherhagmann/Projects/Personal/the_western_horizon/sections/player-guide.html` with:

{% raw %}
```html
---
layout: section
title: Player Guide
section_name: "I-A. The Player's Compass"
section_url: /sections/player-guide
prev_url: /sections/session-zero
prev_title: Session Zero
next_url: /sections/settlements
next_title: Settlements
---

{% include 01a-player-guide.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

### Additional Changes Needed

**Update nav.html** to include new section
**Update index.html** table of contents
**Update session-zero.html** to reference: "Next, see the Player Guide for character creation guidelines"
**Update settlements.html** to reference back: "As established in the Player Guide, players bring goals..."

### Character Creation Form Integration

The existing Character Creation Form should be:
1. Referenced heavily in this section
2. Linked as a downloadable PDF
3. Perhaps converted to an interactive web form (optional)

Current form is good but should be supplemented with:
- Examples of filled-out forms
- Before/after comparison (reactive vs. proactive character)
- Integration with goal-setting framework

---

## STYLE NOTES

This draft intentionally mirrors the tone and formatting of the existing document:

- **Clear hierarchical structure** (H3, H4, H5 for subsections)
- **Tables for comparisons** (Traditional vs. WH)
- **Callout boxes** for key principles
- **Concrete examples** throughout
- **Checklists** for actionable items
- **Conversational but precise** tone

---

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU

1. Should this be one large section or split into two ("Player Expectations" and "Character Creation")?

2. Do you want to keep the current Character Creation Form as-is, or integrate its content directly into this section?

3. Should there be a separate "Quick Start for Players" handout (2-page summary) in addition to this comprehensive guide?

4. How much overlap is okay between this and the Session Zero section? (Some repetition might be valuable for players who skip around.)

5. Do you want concrete examples from your actual campaign, or keep them generic/fictional?

Let me know what you think and I can refine this into final HTML format!
