## Overview

A framework for shifting TTRPG play from GM-driven storylines to player-driven goal pursuit. Instead of the GM creating hooks that players react to, players declare goals and the GM creates obstacles. This inverts the traditional "reactive" model where "evil guys do something, and good guys stop them" into a "proactive" model where players "think about what their characters want, strategize on how to get there, and gleefully blow through all the barriers the Game Master puts in their way."

## Role in The Western Horizon

**Primary Scale:** Meta/Framework (applies to all scales)  
**Used For:** Goal-driven play structure, faction clock mechanics, encounter design philosophy  
**Sections Updated:** `00-overview.html`, `01-session-zero.html`, `02-settlements.html`, `05-quest-prep.html`

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Reactive Play

Traditional "reactive" adventures suffer from several problems:

1. **Creative burden falls on the GM** — The DM prepares everything; players just show up
2. **Player passivity** — Players assume "the story will come to them"
3. **Creative rut** — Every campaign becomes "stop the world-ending threat"
4. **Diminished agency** — Players choose between GM-provided options within pre-planned story beats

### The Proactive Solution

In proactive play:
- Players declare what their characters want
- GM creates obstacles and opposition (not storylines)
- Factions pursue their own goals, creating emergent conflict
- Story emerges from the collision of competing goals

> "Changed our game's culture from one where we told the stories and the players observed to one where we all explored and discovered the story of our game together."

## Core Mechanics

### Player Goals

**The foundation of proactive play.** Each PC needs multiple goals with these properties:

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Player-authored** | Players invent goals, not the GM | — |
| **Multiple** | 3 goals per PC recommended | Short, medium, long-term |
| **Specific & achievable** | Clear end point you can recognize | "Win the tournament in Songul" not "become more powerful" |
| **Consequential** | Failure matters | "...so Su-Li will marry me" |
| **Non-repeatable** | Can't just try again if you fail | Stakes must be real |
| **Fun to pursue** | Can imagine obstacles and encounters | Level-appropriate challenges |

**Design characters backward:** Come up with fun goals first, then design a character around those goals.

**Goal refresh:** Players invent new goals as they complete old ones.

### Factions as "The GM's Party"

> "It's too complicated to track the goals and attitudes of every single NPC in the game. Instead, focus on tracking the goals of the factions that your NPCs belong to."

Factions are the GM-controlled counterparts of the party. Each faction needs:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Identity** | What they do |
| **Area of Operation** | Where they are |
| **Power Level** | Relative to other factions |
| **Ideology** | What they believe |
| **Goals** | What they want (specific, concrete) |

**Critical:** Faction goals must relate to the same people, places, and events as PC goals. This ensures collision.

### Faction Clocks (from Blades in the Dark)

Track faction progress toward goals using **clocks**:
- Circle divided into segments (1, 2, 4, or 8)
- Fill a segment when faction makes progress
- When full, goal is achieved
- Difficulty reflected by segment count

Clocks advance between sessions, creating emergent pressure and hooks.

### NPCs by Role

| Type | Relationship to PCs | Goal Alignment |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Allies** | Beneficial partners | Goals align with PCs |
| **Villains** | Opposition | Goals conflict with PCs |
| **Patrons** | Resource providers | Transactional — help in exchange for advancing patron's goals |

**Key insight for villains:** Design villain goals *in response to* player goals. The villain's goals must overlap with PC goals or players will never care about them.

### Goal Conflict Spectrum

| Conflict Type | Example | Likely Resolution |
|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| **Zero-sum** | PC wants painting; Villain wants to destroy it | Combat |
| **Overlapping** | PC wants painting; Villain wants to forge a copy | Social/negotiation possible |

Vary conflict types to avoid "frustrating slog" of constant direct opposition.

## Key Procedures

### The Seven-Step Encounter Design

1. **Review player goals** — What are they working on right now?
2. **Identify overlapping faction goals** — Which factions care about the same things?
3. **Pick opposing NPC goals** — Specific goals that create obstacles
4. **Choose location** — Where does this encounter happen?
5. **Determine conflict type** — Combat? Social? How will opposition fight?
6. **Determine rewards** — What do players get for success?
7. **Prepare materials** — Maps, minis, stat blocks

### Building Locations Around Goals

Locations don't have goals, but should be built around player goals:
- Some goals name specific locations → design those
- Others imply location types → create appropriate venues
- Work backward: "What would a satisfying conclusion look like?"

### The "+1" Reward Philosophy

When a goal has a built-in reward (find magic sword → get magic sword), add a "+1":
- Connection to ongoing story
- New information about another goal
- Complications or consequences
- Rights, titles, or relationships

## Integration with The Western Horizon

### Goals Replace Hooks

Traditional West Marches uses a **bulletin board** of GM-created hooks. Proactive play inverts this:

| Traditional | Proactive |
|-------------|-----------|
| GM creates hooks | Players arrive with goals |
| Players bite on hooks | GM creates obstacles to goals |
| Story comes to players | Players pursue story |
| "Here's what's available" | "What do you want?" |

### The Bootstrapping Problem Solved

**The problem:** Responsive generation needs player intent, but players need *something* to react to.

**The solution:** Players bring goals from character creation. The GM doesn't need to create hooks—they create *obstacles* to player-declared goals.

### Two Modes of Content

| Mode | Trigger | Depth |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Hook Seeding** | Faction clocks advance, session aftermath | Shallow pointers ("there's a swamp to the northwest") |
| **Content Realization** | Player pursues goal | Deep generation (the swamp's hexes, NPCs, dangers) |

### Faction Integration

Factions from Ex Novo and Beak, Feather & Bone gain:
- **Concrete goals** (not just "identity" and "resources")
- **Clocks** tracking progress
- **Between-session advancement** creating emergent pressure

### Session Zero Additions

Add to Session Zero:
1. Each PC creates 3 goals (short/medium/long-term)
2. Use "What would it look like when you reach your goal?" to refine
3. GM identifies overlaps with starting faction goals
4. Initial obstacles seeded from goal/faction collision

### The Bulletin Board Reconsidered

The bulletin board becomes:
- **Window into faction activity** — Factions post jobs advancing *their* goals
- **Information marketplace** — Rumors informing player goal pursuit
- **Fallback** — For players without clear immediate direction

Not the primary source of adventure hooks.

## Quick Reference

### Player Goal Checklist
- [ ] Player-authored (not GM-suggested)
- [ ] Specific end point ("win tournament" not "get stronger")
- [ ] Clear consequences for failure
- [ ] Non-repeatable (can't just try again)
- [ ] Fun obstacles imaginable
- [ ] Connected to character identity

### Faction Goal Checklist
- [ ] Concrete and specific
- [ ] Overlaps with at least one PC goal
- [ ] Has a clock tracking progress
- [ ] NPCs assigned to advance it
- [ ] Advances between sessions

### Encounter Design Checklist
- [ ] Which PC goal does this advance/obstruct?
- [ ] Which faction goals intersect?
- [ ] What type of conflict? (combat/social/exploration)
- [ ] What's the "+1" beyond the obvious reward?

## Key Quotes

> "The encounter, not the adventure, is the fundamental unit of play. String enough encounters together and an adventure with a very clear arc will emerge from the conflict and actions players take to resolve it."

> "Make sure your factions have goals that relate to the same people, places and events as your PC's goals."

> "If you can fail at achieving a goal only to try it again, then it doesn't mean anything to fail."

> "Enlist your player's help in designing content" by asking "What would it look like when you reach your goal?"

## Adaptation Notes

For The Western Horizon:
- Goals don't replace responsive generation—they **trigger** it
- Faction goals come from Ex Novo/BF&B faction creation, then get refined with specific objectives
- Clocks provide between-session pressure without requiring GM-authored storylines
- The "always existed" principle still applies—generated content becomes permanent canon
