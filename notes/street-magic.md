# Street Magic Notes

**System:** I'm Sorry Did You Say Street Magic
**Author:** Caro Asercion
**Supplement:** Easy Streets anthology
**Use Case:** Collaborative building-scale worldbuilding

## What Street Magic Solves for Western Horizon

### The Core Problem
When Hexmancer generates a feature (temple, wizard's tower, village) or when players enter a settlement district, you need **specific locations with personality**. Street Magic provides a lightweight, collaborative system for creating memorable buildings and NPCs that feel lived-in without requiring extensive prep.

### The Three-Tier Structure
Street Magic builds cities through nested cards:
- **Neighborhoods** → Broad areas with reputation and vibe
- **Landmarks** → Specific buildings/locations within neighborhoods
- **Residents** → Individual NPCs associated with landmarks

---

## Integration Points

### 1. Settlement Creation (Part II)
**When:** Ex Novo generates a settlement with districts
**Then:** Use Street Magic to populate 2-3 key landmarks per district

**Why this works:**
- Fast collaborative generation (5-10 min per landmark)
- Creates sensory, memorable details ("true names")
- Natural NPC generation through residents

### 2. Wilderness Feature Detailing
**When:** Hexmancer generates temple/tower/castle (d20: 11-17)
**Then:** Use Street Magic Landmark procedure to detail it

**Example workflow:**
1. Hexmancer: "Hex 03.05 has a temple"
2. Street Magic: "The Temple of Smoke and Mirrors—address: At the Crossroads, true name: incense thick enough to taste, reflective obsidian walls"
3. If players engage, add Resident: "The Keeper (they/them)—watches from the shadows, never blinks"

### 3. Notable Buildings (Settlement Section)
**When:** Ex Novo establishes a settlement
**Before session:** Run abbreviated Street Magic to create 3-5 landmarks
**During session:** Add more landmarks/residents as needed

**Integration with BF&B:**
- Beak, Feather & Bone provides **roles and relationships**
- Street Magic provides **sensory details and specific locations**
- Use both: BF&B for faction roles, Street Magic for where they operate

### 4. Key NPCs (Settlement Section)
**When:** Players need contacts, quest-givers, or recurring characters
**Then:** Use Street Magic Resident procedure (collaborative vignettes)

**Why residents matter:**
- **Collaborative vignettes** create memorable first impressions
- **True names** make NPCs stick in memory
- NPCs are always tied to **specific locations** (easier to track)

## Street Magic Mechanics

### Neighborhood Cards
**Elements:**
- **Title:** What locals call it ("The Rookery," "Saltmarket")
- **Reputation:** General vibe in 2-3 sentences (residential? commercial? how do others view it?)
- **True Name:** Sensory/poetic essence (what you see/smell/hear/taste)

**For Western Horizon:**
Use Ex Novo districts → Convert to Street Magic neighborhoods for detailing

### Landmark Cards
**Elements:**
- **Title:** Common name ("The Gilt Rose Inn")
- **Address:** Location within neighborhood ("Three blocks from the fountain, above the cobbler's")
- **True Name:** Unique sensory details ("sawdust floors smell of pine, firelight dances on copper mugs")

**For Western Horizon:**
- Landmarks = Buildings players will actually visit
- 2-3 per district is sufficient
- Add more reactively as players explore

### Resident Cards
**Elements:**
- **Title & Pronouns:** Common name ("The Lamplighter, she/her")
- **Collaborative Vignette:** Short scene establishing character in their element
- **True Name:** Created through vignette ("hands always smudged with oil, hums old mining songs")

**For Western Horizon:**
- Use for recurring NPCs, quest-givers, faction leaders
- Vignettes take 5-10 minutes
- **Optional speed variant:** DM dictates vignette instead of collaborative scene

## The "True Name" Concept

**What it is:** A poetic, sensory essence that makes something unforgettable

**Examples:**
- Neighborhood: "clockwork precision, chrome and glass, everyone's in a hurry"
- Landmark: "velvet curtains thick with dust, stage lights barely flicker, ghosts in the balcony"
- Resident: "calloused hands, speaks in recipe measurements, smells of cardamom"

**Why it works for Western Horizon:**
- Forces specific, evocative details
- Easy for DM to recall during sessions
- Gives players clear mental images
- Anchors locations and NPCs in memory

**How to create:**
Ask: "What do you **see, smell, hear, feel, taste?**"

---

## Compass & Events (Optional)

Street Magic's full game includes:
- **Compass:** Thematic focus for a round ("gentrification," "night markets," "found family")
- **Events:** Changes to the city after exploration

**For Western Horizon:**
Skip Compass/Events for initial landmark generation. **Use them for:**
- Session Zero settlement creation (full collaborative session)
- Between-arc "city evolves" updates
- Solo DM brainstorming when stuck

---

## Practical Workflow

### Quick Landmark Generation (10 minutes)
**Used when:** Hexmancer generates temple/tower/castle, or players arrive at new settlement

1. **Title:** What do locals call it? (30 seconds)
2. **Address:** Where is it? How do you get there? (1 minute)
3. **True Name:** Close your eyes. What's the first thing you notice? (2-3 minutes, discuss)
4. **Optional Resident:** Does someone notable work/live here? (5-7 minutes if yes)

**Example:**
- Hexmancer result: "Temple in the woods"
- Title: "The Thorngate Chapel"
- Address: "End of the pilgrim trail, half-buried in brambles"
- True Name: "stained glass filters green light, floor covered in fallen leaves, smells of wet earth and old prayers"
- Resident: "Brother Moss (he/him)—tends the garden graves, speaks to the trees"

### Full Session Zero Settlement (2-3 hours)
**Used when:** Creating Tier 2+ settlement from scratch

1. Run abbreviated Ex Novo (1 hour) → Establishes districts, factions, founding
2. Switch to Street Magic (1-2 hours) → Create 5-10 landmarks across districts
3. Add 3-5 key residents through collaborative vignettes

**Result:** Settlement with history (Ex Novo) + memorable locations and NPCs (Street Magic)

### Reactive NPC Addition (5-10 minutes)
**Used when:** Players ask "who runs this place?"

1. **Title & Pronouns:** Quick decision
2. **Collaborative Vignette:**
   - DM: "Let's see them in their element. Where are they and what are they doing?"
   - Players contribute: "I see them..." "I hear..." "They're holding..."
   - Stop when you have their **true name**
3. Write it down, add to wiki

## What Street Magic Doesn't Do

❌ Generate settlement-scale geography (use Ex Novo)
❌ Track faction relationships (use Ex Novo/Kingdom/BF&B)
❌ Handle dungeon interiors (use Ex Umbra)
❌ Manage settlement mechanics (use Ex Novo "needs")

---

## Key Modifications for Western Horizon

### 1. Abbreviated Creation
Street Magic's full game has rounds with Compass/Events. For Western Horizon:
- **Just use the card creation procedures**
- Skip rounds/Compass until you need them
- Add landmarks/residents **reactively** as players explore

### 2. Tie to Existing Systems
- **Ex Novo** establishes districts → Street Magic details them
- **BF&B** establishes roles → Street Magic creates their workplaces
- **Hexmancer features** → Street Magic adds personality

### 3. Wiki Integration
Each landmark/resident becomes a wiki page:
- **Landmark page:** Title, Address, True Name, Associated Residents, Session appearances
- **Resident page:** Title, Pronouns, True Name, Affiliated Landmark, Relationships

## Key Insight

Street Magic's strength is creating **specific, sensory, memorable details** through collaboration. The "true name" concept forces evocative description that sticks in everyone's mind.

Perfect for Western Horizon because:
- Reactive (can generate quickly during or between sessions)
- Collaborative (players help create the world)
- Memorable (true names make locations/NPCs stick)
- Modular (add landmarks/residents as needed, no upfront commitment)

Use it to answer: "What does this place **feel** like?" rather than just "What is it?"
