# Faction Scope & Player Scale

## Overview

Factions pursue their goals regardless of PC involvement. However, the problems players can meaningfully solve match their tier and reach. This creates a natural scaling mechanic without requiring GMs to artificially limit player agency.

## Core Principle

**Factions pursue their goals. Players experience the consequences, not the obligation to fix them.**

## Faction Goals vs. Player Agency

Factions have objectives that will pursue regardless of PC involvement:
- The neighboring country wants to expand territory
- The Merchant's Guild wants to monopolize trade
- The Church wants to convert the heretical villages

These happen. The world changes. Prices rise. Resources become scarce. NPCs you care about suffer losses.

### Players experience friction from these goals:
- War tax makes their blacksmith friend's business harder
- Swamp moss shortage means higher prices for their potions
- Religious persecution creates refugees who need help

**But friction ≠ obligation.** The players can:
1. **Engage strategically** with the friction (sell the refugees information, profit from price gouging, help smuggle goods around the embargo)
2. **Work around it** (find alternative suppliers, operate during the chaos)
3. **Ignore it** (pursue their own goals while the war grinds on)
4. **React to it** (if it directly threatens their stated goal)

## Scale, Power, and Scope

**The problems players can realistically solve match their tier and reach.**

A level 3 adventurer in a small town can't stop a war or pressure the Merchant's Guild—but they *can* help a single blacksmith adapt to war-time scarcity by finding alternative suppliers, harvesting swamp moss to ease a local shortage, or helping that NPC navigate the disruption. The war continues. The world changes. Their actions are local and constrained.

A level 15 renowned figure in the capital operates at a different scale. They have political capital, resources, and connections that allow them to pressure guilds, influence nobles, or even reshape regional policy. At that tier, engaging with faction-level problems becomes *appropriate* because their stage is the same stage those factions operate on.

### The absurdity cuts both ways:
- It would be ridiculous for a level 3 to spend weeks trying to pressure the Guild or stop the war themselves
- It would be equally ridiculous for a level 15 to spend weeks harvesting swamp moss when they could hire someone, negotiate supplier agreements, or leverage their influence

### What stays constant:
Friction exists at all tiers. The difference is *which friction matters to which characters*, and *at what scale they can meaningfully act*.

A level 3's blacksmith friend faces a Guild monopoly problem. They can help *that NPC* navigate it through direct aid.

A level 15 can pressure the Guild itself through leverage and influence.

Both are addressing the same systemic friction. One is personal-scale, one is political-scale.

## Avoiding the "Save the World" Treadmill

By tying player scope to tier and position, you prevent the false escalation where low-level characters are expected to solve world problems. Scope becomes a natural consequence of power and reach, not heroic obligation.

The war doesn't need to be stopped by the players. It needs to create friction they can engage with at their scale.
