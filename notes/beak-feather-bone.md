# Beak, Feather & Bone

> **Author:** Tyler Crumrine, Jonathan Yee, Austin Breed
> **Publisher:** Possible Worlds Games
> **Pages:** 32
> **Session Length:** 15 minutes (quick) to 4 hours (full)
> **Players:** 1-10+ (flexible)

## Overview

A map-labeling game where players claim buildings on an unlabeled city map through the lens of competing factions. You're not building a city—you're discovering what already exists by defining each structure's purpose, appearance, and reality through three-sentence descriptions (Beak, Feather, Bone).

## Role in The Western Horizon

**Primary Scale:** Settlement
**Used For:** Generating towns/cities with factional politics and built-in plot hooks
**Sections Updated:** `02-settlements.html`, `03-factions.html`, `04-npcs.html`

## Why This System Fits Western Horizon

### The "Discovery Not Creation" Alignment

BF&B's core premise perfectly matches WH's reactive philosophy:
- **The map exists before you define it** = settlements exist before players visit
- **You reveal, not invent** = GMs discover alongside players what's there
- **Blank spaces are intentional** = partial definition creates framework, not straitjacket

**For West Marches:** Different parties can interact with same settlement from different factional perspectives without contradicting established facts.

### The Three-Layer Description System

**Beak** (reputation) / **Feather** (appearance) / **Bone** (reality) teaches critical GM skill:
- What locals **say** about a place (hooks, rumors)
- What it **looks like** (immediate player information)
- What it **actually is** (secret, revelation, twist)

**This is transferable** beyond BF&B—apply to any location in WH.

### Competitive Collaboration

Players compete for influence (Seat of Power) but **must build on** each other's contributions:
- Can't contradict established facts
- Must reference existing elements
- Creates organic tensions without conflict

**Perfect for rotating GMs:** Settlements gain complexity as different GMs add to them without erasing previous work.

## Core Mechanics Worth Extracting

### The Faction Lens System

10 archetypal factions (Mages, Miners, Farmers, Ranchers, Thieves, Soldiers, Merchants, Elders, Clerics, Strangers) interpret buildings through their interests:

- **Not demographics** (they're power structures, not census data)
- **Not comprehensive** (most people aren't in any faction)
- **Interpretive lenses** (same faction means different things in different settlements)

**Use in WH:** Quick faction selection for any settlement based on terrain + plot needs.

### The Suit as Temporal Frame

Card suits create four time-lenses for buildings:
- **♥ Hearts:** Social purpose (present-tense community function)
- **♦ Diamonds:** Financial purpose (present-tense economic role)
- **♣ Clubs:** Future purpose (under construction, preparation, aspiration)
- **♠ Spades:** Past purpose (abandoned, historical, sealed)

**Why this matters:** Settlements feel lived-in when they have history (♠), present (♥♦), and future (♣). Check for temporal balance.

### Face Cards Generate NPCs

Jack/Queen/King = 0 influence BUT also create a **Rival** from opposing faction:
- Described in Beak/Feather/Bone format
- Clear opposition to your building's purpose
- Named NPC with motivation

**This is gold:** Automatic quest-giver generation. Every J/Q/K creates plot thread.

## Key Procedures

### Quick Settlement Generation (15-30 min)

**When to use:** Party discovers unnamed settlement mid-session
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes
**Output:** 4-6 defined buildings with one conflict hook

**Steps:**
1. Pick 2 factions based on hex terrain (e.g., Plains = Farmers + Ranchers)
2. Each faction takes 2-3 turns (4-6 buildings total)
3. Use only face cards for NPC generation (discard number cards if needed)
4. Faction with higher total controls settlement

**Result:** Enough definition to run session, ~90% left undefined for future.

### Full Settlement Development (2-4 hours)

**When to use:** Session zero hometown, major campaign hub, downtime activity
**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Output:** 25-40 buildings, complex political web, multiple NPCs

**Steps:**
1. Choose 5+ factions (players pick or assign based on character backgrounds)
2. 5-10 turns per faction
3. Track ALL card draws (including numbers for NPC generation)
4. Calculate Seat of Power at end (highest total = ruling faction)

**Result:** Deep settlement with established canon that still leaves room for growth.

### Ongoing Settlement Evolution

**When to use:** Settlement grows with campaign
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes per session
**Output:** 1-2 new buildings per session

**Steps:**
1. At session end, identify which factions were active (mentioned, interacted with)
2. Active factions add 1 building each
3. Track influence totals—Seat of Power can shift
4. Destroyed/changed buildings become available for redefinition

**Result:** Living settlement responsive to party actions.

## Integration Notes

### Inputs (What This System Needs)

- **Empty or partially-filled map** (provided in book, or use Claw Atlas to generate)
- **Terrain context** (influences faction selection)
- **Scale decision** (hamlet vs. town vs. city = how many factions)

### Outputs (What This System Produces)

- **Defined buildings** with layered descriptions (Beak/Feather/Bone)
- **Factional power map** (influence scores)
- **Named NPCs** (from face cards—rivals with clear motivations)
- **Settlement leadership** (Seat of Power winner)
- **Adventure hooks** (rivalries, contested buildings, faction conflicts)

### Handoff To

- **Chronicle/Microscope:** Use ♠ (Past) buildings as seeds for historical events
- **Street Magic:** Zoom into specific buildings for detailed neighborhood mapping
- **Delve:** ♠ buildings become dungeon sites (abandoned temples, sealed vaults)

### What NOT To Do

**Don't over-define:** Most value comes from the *framework*, not total completion. Aim for 30-50% definition maximum.

**Don't treat as simulation:** It's storytelling tool, not city planning software. Narrative truth beats realistic logistics.

**Don't explain to players:** Just describe the settlement. They don't need to know it came from BF&B.

**Don't ignore blank spaces:** They're **opportunity**, not failure. Future GMs/sessions fill them in.

## Adaptation Notes

### Modifications for WH

**Time Scaling:** Original assumes single 2-4 hour session. WH adds:
- Quick mode (15-30 min, 2 factions, 2-3 turns each)
- Ongoing mode (add 1-2 buildings per session over campaign)

**Faction Selection:** Original offers all 10 factions. WH adds **terrain-based selection**:
- Plains → Farmers, Ranchers, Merchants, Elders
- Hills → Miners, Soldiers, Ranchers, Hunters
- Woods → Hunters, Farmers, Strangers, Thieves
- Mountains → Miners, Soldiers, Mages, Clerics

**Map Flexibility:** Original requires pre-made map. WH adds:
- Use Claw Atlas Mapmaker variant (procedural generation)
- Use any map (settlement, district, building cluster)
- Abstract completely (list-based, no map)

## Quick Reference

**The 30-Second Version:**

1. Pick 2-4 factions for settlement (based on terrain/plot)
2. Each faction draws cards and claims buildings (2-5 turns each)
3. For each building, write 3 sentences: **Beak** (rumor), **Feather** (appearance), **Bone** (reality)
4. Face cards (J/Q/K) also create named NPC rival from opposing faction
5. Highest card total = Seat of Power (ruling faction)

**Key Output:** Settlement with defined buildings, clear politics, and built-in NPCs/conflicts.
