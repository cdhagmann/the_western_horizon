## Overview

Ex Novo is a map-drawing game where players collaboratively generate settlements with rich histories, landmarks, and factions. Starting from a blank map, the game guides players through founding a settlement, then playing through dramatic historical events that shape its development over time. The result is a living city with visible layers of history, competing power structures, and meaningful geography.

## Role in The Western Horizon

**Primary Scale:** Settlement
**Used For:** Founding new settlements, establishing starting locations, creating settlement histories
**Sections Updated:** `_includes/02-settlements.html`, `_includes/01-session-zero.html`

**When to Use:**
- **Session Zero:** Generate the starting settlement (usually a Village or Town tier)
- **Campaign Expansion:** When players establish or discover new settlements
- **Historical Context:** To retroactively develop a settlement's backstory when needed

## Core Concepts

### Settlement as Palimpsest
Ex Novo treats settlements as layered documents where history is visible in the present. Districts, landmarks, and factions bear the marks of past events. A harbor district might be abandoned after a plague; a landmark temple could mark where two factions reconciled. The map itself becomes a visual timeline.

**For WH:** This concept supports responsive generation—when players arrive at a settlement, its "history" is generated to explain what exists now. The visible layers create prompts for adventure hooks.

### Geographic Foundation
Settlement identity begins with geography: mountains, rivers, coastlines, valleys. These aren't decorative—they're the *reason* the settlement exists and shape its development. The terrain determines resources, defensibility, climate, and cultural attitudes.

**For WH:** Geography generation creates immediate adventure potential (dangerous mountains, mysterious forests, strategic chokepoints). It also scales naturally—Villages fit in valleys, Cities span multiple terrain types.

### Factions as Living Forces
Factions aren't static power structures but dynamic forces with symbols, influence levels, and relationships. They gain and lose power, clash and cooperate, and physically manifest in landmarks. Power tokens make faction influence concrete and trackable.

**For WH:** This gives the DM concrete power dynamics to inform NPC motivations and plot hooks. When players arrive, existing faction tensions create immediate story potential.

### Events as Catalysts
The Development Phase plays through historical events (wars, discoveries, disasters, fashions) that shape the settlement. Each event has mechanical consequences—adding districts, destroying landmarks, shifting power—that leave visible marks.

**For WH:** Events serve as pre-generated adventure seeds. "Twenty years ago, a war destroyed the harbor district" becomes "What caused the war? What's still buried in the ruins?" The timeline creates implicit mysteries.

### Scale Through Detail
Ex Novo scales settlements through six tiers (Village to Metropolis), each defined by:
- **Region Count:** How many districts/areas exist
- **Population Density:** Low/medium/high options
- **Power Token Pool:** Amount of factional influence
- **Historical Depth:** Number of formative events (City Age)

**For WH Integration:** Map directly to WH tiers:
- **Tier 1-4 (Village):** Nestling/Budding age, 6-9 regions, sparse population
- **Tier 5-10 (Town):** Grown age, 9-12 regions, moderate density
- **Tier 11-16 (City):** Aged/Elderly, 12-18 regions, high density
- **Tier 17+ (Capital):** Ancient, 20+ regions, metropolis density

### Zoom Levels
Ex Novo provides three temporal lenses for examining settlements:

**Past (Historical Depth)**
- How events shaped architecture, cuisine, rituals, movement patterns
- What stories and accounts persist
- "What made this place what it is?"

**Present (Street Level)**
- Visual character: signs, colors, building materials
- Gathering spots and entertainment
- Where history remains visible
- "What does daily life feel like here?"

**Future (Factional Tensions)**
- Leadership succession and power struggles
- Dangers faced and preparations made
- Opportunities being pursued
- Flexibility vs. rigidity in adapting to change
- "Where is this place going?"

**For WH:** These lenses guide *when* to use Ex Novo:
- Generate Past/Present before players arrive (establish baseline)
- Develop Future during campaign (factions respond to player actions)
- Use zoom prompts (p. 23) when players ask "what's this place like?"

## Key Elements

### The Map as Primary Artifact
The hand-drawn map is the game's central output—not a polished illustration but a working document that evolves. Region lines divide space, districts fill areas, landmarks mark important sites, and resources show what the land provides.

**For WH:** The map becomes the DM's reference. When running Street Magic (building scale) or planning adventures, the Ex Novo map shows where things are and why. Export as image for wiki, annotate for notes.

### Resource Economy
Resources (minerals, farmland, forests, etc.) generate power tokens that factions compete over. Resources tie directly to terrain and explain both prosperity and conflict. They're not abstract—they occupy map space and can be depleted, captured, or enhanced.

**For WH:** Resources create immediate quest hooks:
- "The copper mine the Mining Guild controls is playing out"
- "The Sacred Grove resource is threatened by loggers"
- Resources also justify settlement tier—Villages have one key resource, Cities have many

### Districts & Landmarks
**Districts:** Residential, commercial, or specialized areas that hold population (citizen tokens). They expand through growth, can be destroyed by disasters, and reflect the settlement's character.

**Landmarks:** Visually distinctive features that embody factions, commemorate events, or mark resources. They're concrete anchors for identity—temples, monuments, fortifications, markets.

**For WH:** When players ask "where do we find X?" reference district types. Landmarks become mini-dungeons or social hubs (BF&B can detail them). District destruction creates adventure sites (ruins, recovery efforts).

### Power Token Economy
Three token types create a closed economy:
- **Citizen Tokens:** Population, placed on districts
- **Power Tokens:** Factional influence, placed on factions/resources/landmarks
- **Growth Pool:** Unallocated potential, drawn from as needed

Tokens move between these categories as events unfold. When a district is destroyed, citizens return to the growth pool. When a faction gains influence, power tokens move to it. This creates visible consequences and constrains growth.

**For WH:** Token distribution shows settlement health and factional strength at a glance. Track on settlement sheet rather than physical tokens.

### Timeline as Chronicle
The timeline tracks all Development Phase events chronologically, providing a historical record. Each box represents one dramatic moment (5-150 years, depending on settlement age). The timeline explains *why* the settlement looks and functions as it does now.

**For WH:** The timeline serves multiple purposes:
- **Prep Reference:** Quick summary of settlement history
- **Plot Hook Generator:** Each event is a potential mystery or consequence
- **Player Handout:** Share publicly known history
- **Future Seeds:** Add events during play as settlements evolve

## Adaptation for The Western Horizon

### Streamlined Generation
**Original:** Full 4-phase playthrough with dice rolls
**WH Adaptation:**
- **For Starting Settlement:** Use full generation once at Session Zero
- **For New Settlements:** Use Founding Phase only, then place 2-4 Development events based on tier
- **For Background Settlements:** Use quick-start tables only (Geography + Location + 2 Factions)

### Responsive History
**Original:** Complete chronological timeline
**WH Adaptation:** Generate history *backwards* from present need:
1. Start with what exists now (players want a mining town)
2. Roll 3-5 historical events that explain it
3. Arrange chronologically
4. Fill gaps as needed during play

This maintains Ex Novo's layered quality without requiring full chronological development.

### Tier-Aligned Scaling
Use Ex Novo's scale tables but align to WH tiers:

| WH Tier | Settlement Type | Ex Novo Age | Regions | Power Tokens | Events |
|---------|----------------|-------------|---------|--------------|---------|
| 1-4 | Village | Nestling-Budding | 6-9 | 6-9 | 5-10 |
| 5-10 | Town | Grown | 9-12 | 12-16 | 10-20 |
| 11-16 | City | Aged-Elderly | 12-18 | 16-20 | 20-40 |
| 17+ | Capital | Ancient | 20+ | 25+ | 40+ |

### Faction Integration
**Modification:** Connect Ex Novo factions to Guild structure:
- At least one faction is a **Guild Branch** (local Adventurers' Guild presence)
- Other factions represent local power (merchants, nobles, temples, etc.)
- Guild relationship with each faction informs quest availability

### Map Format
**Original:** Hand-drawn on paper
**WH Adaptation:**
- Initial generation: Still hand-draw (faster, more creative)
- Post-generation: Digitize for wiki using:
  - Photo/scan of original map
  - Or recreate in simple tool (Wonderdraft, Inkarnate, even Google Drawings)
  - Add layer with keyed locations for DM reference
- Store both versions: visual map for players, annotated map for DM

## Quick Reference

### The 30-Second Version

**To Generate a Settlement:**
1. **Roll Geography** (terrain type + 4 features)
2. **Place Founding Resource** (why settle here?)
3. **Add Starting District** (where do people live?)
4. **Create 2 Factions** (who has power?)
5. **Name the Settlement**
6. **Roll 3-8 Historical Events** (what shaped it?)
7. **Spend Growth Pool** (final developments)
8. **Add Secondary Name** (local nickname)

**Output:** Map with districts/landmarks, timeline of events, faction power levels, resource locations.

**Before Players Arrive:** Review map for adventure hooks, note factional tensions, identify obvious landmarks they'd see.

## Practical Workflow for WH

### Session Zero (Starting Settlement)
1. **Setup Phase:** Choose Village or Town tier
2. **Founding Phase:** Full generation with player input
   - Players suggest terrain types
   - GM rolls, players interpret prompts collaboratively
   - Players name districts, factions, landmarks
3. **Development Phase:** Play through 5-10 events
4. **Document:** Transfer to wiki with map image

**Duration:** 90-120 minutes
**Players:** All present, contributing ideas

### New Settlement During Campaign
**When:** Players express intent to visit a new settlement

**Prep Session (GM + interested players):**
1. Choose tier based on context
2. Quick Founding (geography, resource, 1 district, 2 factions)
3. Roll key events (2-4 for village, 4-8 for town/city)
4. Sketch map, note hooks
5. Update wiki

**Duration:** 30-60 minutes
**Can be async:** GM rolls, shares in Discord for player naming/interpretation

### Background Settlements (GM Only)
**When:** Settlement exists but players won't visit immediately

**Quick Generation:**
1. Roll Geography (p. 36) and Location (p. 38)
2. Roll 2 Factions: Paradigm (p. 40) and Relationship (p. 41)
3. Note settlement name and tier
4. Add to regional map with 1-sentence description

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Expand Later:** If players express intent, do full generation before visit

## Essential Tables Reference

**All tables in Ex Novo use 2d6:**

- **Terrain–Geography** (p. 36): Major landscape type
- **Terrain–Features** (p. 37): 4x topographic details
- **Purpose–Location** (p. 38): Founding resource
- **Purpose–Decision** (p. 39): Why settlement exists
- **Power–Paradigm** (p. 40): First faction nature
- **Power–Relationship** (p. 41): Second faction relationship to first
- **Events Table** (p. 42-59): 18 categories × 6 results = 108 historical events

**Ex Novo Insight:** Event categories aren't random—they represent broad historical forces (war, trade, nature, faith, etc.). Roll category first (d6 + d6), then specific event within category (d6). This two-stage roll creates thematic clustering while maintaining variety.

## Zooming In (Optional Depth)

When players want more detail, use Ex Novo's "Zooming In" prompts (p. 23):

**Historical Depth (Past):**
- Has this event been immortalized in art/architecture?
- Did it affect local cuisine?
- Did it create district rituals?
- Did it change how people/things move?
- Is it retold in stories/accounts?

**Street Level (Present):**
- What signs/colors/images are visible?
- What are buildings built from?
- Where do people gather? Why?
- How do people entertain themselves?
- Where is history visible?
- How do landmarks integrate into daily life?

**Factional Tensions (Future):**
- Who's next in leadership?
- What danger is the faction facing?
- What opportunities are they exploiting?
- Who are they trying to court as allies?
- How flexible vs. rigid are they?
- How do they feel about their power position?

**Use These:** When running BF&B or Street Magic to detail specific districts. Or when players ask direct questions about settlement life.

## Integration Handoffs

### When Starting a Campaign
**Ex Novo → Session Zero:**
- Generate starting settlement collaboratively
- Establish Guild presence as one faction
- Timeline events suggest campaign palette/themes
- Map becomes shared reference

### When Players Declare Intent
**Player Intent → Ex Novo → Prep:**
- "We want to visit the mountain fortress city"
- Generate fortress city using Ex Novo (2-tier higher than party level)
- Extract adventure hooks from factions/timeline
- Detail entry district with BF&B
- Prep 2-3 encounter locations

**Duration:** 1-2 hours prep, then session-ready

### Mid-Campaign Expansion
**Ex Novo → Ongoing Campaign:**
- Roll new events during downtime (settlements evolve)
- Add events triggered by player actions
- Let timeline grow organically
- Update wiki with changes

**Example:** "Your victory over the dragon cult becomes a settlement event: 'The Purge of the Cult' (20 years ago). A commemorative landmark is built. The temple faction gains power."

### Recording to Wiki
**Session Output → Wiki Update:**
After players visit a settlement:
1. Annotate Ex Novo map with player discoveries
2. Add NPCs encountered to faction entries
3. Note which districts players explored
4. Create location pages for landmarks visited
5. Update timeline with player-caused events

Claude Projects can process session recordings: "Extract all references to Rivertown, including NPCs met, locations visited, and plot developments. Update the wiki entry."

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall: Over-Generating Before Play
**Problem:** Spending hours detailing settlements players might never visit
**Solution:** Use three-tier approach:
1. **Immediate:** Full Ex Novo for starting settlement and next destination
2. **Near:** Quick generation (geography + factions) for visible/mentioned settlements
3. **Background:** Name and one-line description only, expand if players express interest

### Pitfall: Ignoring Generated History
**Problem:** Cool timeline events get forgotten, serve no purpose
**Solution:**
- Pull 2-3 events as explicit adventure hooks before each arc
- Give NPCs memories of past events ("I remember the fire...")
- Make landmarks physically reflect their history
- Let players discover evidence of past events

### Pitfall: Static Factions
**Problem:** Factions frozen at generation, don't respond to play
**Solution:**
- After major arcs, add new timeline event reflecting player actions
- Let factions gain/lose power tokens based on player choices
- Destroyed landmarks stay destroyed (mark on map)
- New districts emerge (expansion, recovery)

### Pitfall: Map-Scale Confusion
**Problem:** Not clear what map scale represents
**Solution:** Use Ex Novo's guidelines (p. 22):
- **Village/Town:** Each region ≈ 0.5 km²
- **Small/Medium City:** Each region ≈ 1 km²
- **Large City/Metropolis:** Each region ≈ 2 km²
- State scale explicitly when describing: "The harbor district is about half a mile across"

### Pitfall: Prompt Rejection
**Problem:** Rolled prompt doesn't fit setting/tone
**Solution:** Ex Novo explicitly encourages reinterpretation:
- Modify prompts to fit palette (swap "divine command" to "noble decree" in low-magic)
- Combine with adjacent roll if one is weak
- Reroll if truly incompatible
- Players have creative freedom as active player (p. 6)
