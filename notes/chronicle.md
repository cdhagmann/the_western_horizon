# Microscope: Chronicle Notes

**System:** Microscope: Chronicle (Playtest 2025)
**Author:** Ben Robbins
**Status:** PRIMARY history system for Western Horizon
**Use Case:** Single-location history (settlement, object, organization)

---

## Why Chronicle is Perfect for Western Horizon

### The Scaling Insight

**Chronicle for Lower Tiers** → **Full Microscope for Higher Tiers**

Your observation is brilliant: the scope of what players need to know should scale with their tier and settlement size:

**Tier 1-2 (Hamlet/Town):**
- **Use Chronicle** - Focus on THIS settlement's history
- Don't need to know the kingdom, capital, or other major cities
- Anchor characters are local: founders, early settlers, key NPCs
- Periods span the settlement's lifetime (decades, maybe a century)

**Tier 3-4 (City/Capital):**
- **Use Full Microscope** - Zoom out to regional/world history
- NEED to know: neighboring cities, kingdom structure, major conflicts
- Capital has representatives from all major cities → must know those places
- Periods span centuries, include multiple civilizations
- Broader context for why THIS place matters

**Result:** Start focused, expand naturally as campaign scope increases.

## What Chronicle Does

Creates the history of **a single Chronicle** (city, sword, secret society, space station) through the lives of **Anchors** (characters connected to it).

### Core Difference from Standard Microscope

| Microscope | Chronicle |
|------------|-----------|
| Entire civilization/world | Single thing (city, object, org) |
| Broad, sweeping history | Personal, character-focused |
| Can lose focus | Stays tightly focused |
| Good for Session Zero world | Good for settlement history |

### For Western Horizon

**Perfect for creating settlement history when:**
- Reaching new tier and establishing new settlement
- Players want backstory for current settlement
- Need to understand settlement's defining moments
- Want to create key NPCs (Anchors) with historical context

---

## Chronicle Procedure (Abbreviated)

### Setup (Steps 1-5)

**Step 1: Pick Our Chronicle**
- The thing you're creating history for
- "The frontier town of Millhaven"
- "The legendary sword Voidrazor"
- "The Merchant's Guild"
- Add one sentence describing what makes it unique

**Step 2: Bookends**
- **START Period:** How does the Chronicle begin?
- **END Period:** How does it end (or where it is "now" in campaign)?
- Each Period is Light or Dark (broad mood/outcome)
- These are the earliest and latest parts of the story

**Step 3: Palette**
- **Yes List:** Things we definitely want in this history
- **No List:** Things we don't want (tone, content, themes)
- Safety tool + creative alignment

**Step 4: End Discussion**
- From now on, contribute individually
- Don't coach or suggest on others' turns
- Don't contradict established history
- Can ask questions for clarity

**Step 5: First Pass**
- Each player makes one Period or Event
- **Period** = large chunk of time between bookends
- **Event** = specific thing that happens within a Period

**Step 6: Second Pass**
- Each player makes one Event or Anchor
- **Anchor** = character connected to the Chronicle
- Anchors are tied to specific Periods

### Ongoing Play (Rounds)

Each round:
1. **Pick Anchor:** First player chooses existing Anchor or creates new one
2. **Take Turns:** Each player makes Period/Event/Scene about that Anchor
3. **Wrap Up:** First player takes final turn to conclude Anchor's story arc
4. **Free Roam:** Next player makes anything anywhere (doesn't need to relate to Anchor)
5. **Rotate:** New first player, repeat

**Play until satisfied** - typically 3-5 hours for complete settlement history

## The Three Elements

### Periods (Tall Cards)
- **Major chunks of time** (years, decades, centuries)
- Flow left to right (earlier → later)
- Can insert new Periods between existing ones
- Each is Light or Dark
- Broad overview, not detailed

**Example for Millhaven:**
- "Founding Period: Desperate refugees flee the old kingdom"
- "Golden Age: Trade routes established, prosperity blooms"
- "The Occupation: Foreign power seizes control"

### Events (Wide Cards)
- **Specific things that happen** within a Period
- Chronological within their Period (earlier on top)
- Complete description with outcome
- Each is Light or Dark

**Example:**
- Period: "The Occupation"
- Event: "The guild master secretly negotiates with rebels, is discovered and publicly executed"

### Anchors (Wide Cards, Above Periods)
- **Named characters** tied to specific Periods
- Show the Chronicle through their eyes
- Can appear in multiple Periods sparingly
- Created with title and basic concept

**Example:**
- Period: "Founding Period"
- Anchor: "Mara Ironwood, blacksmith who rallied refugees to defend the first settlement"

**Integration with Street Magic:** Anchors from Chronicle → Residents in Street Magic (add sensory details and vignettes)

---

## Optional: Scenes

**Dictated Scenes** (one player narrates)
- Quick way to show a moment in history
- Player describes what happens, no collaboration
- Faster than Played Scenes

**Played Scenes** (collaborative roleplay)
- Everyone takes a character and roleplays
- Answers a question about history
- More immersive but takes longer
- Completely optional

**For Western Horizon:** Usually skip scenes in favor of Dictated approach to keep history creation moving.

## Integration with Western Horizon

### When to Run Chronicle

**Tier 1 (Levels 1-4): Hamlet → Village**
- **At founding** or **when reaching Tier 2**
- Chronicle = The settlement
- 3 Periods minimum: Founding → Development → Current State
- 3-5 Anchors: Founders, key figures
- Duration: 1-2 hours

**Tier 2 (Levels 5-10): Town**
- **When established** or **reaching Tier 3**
- Chronicle = The town
- Add more Periods: Growth, conflicts, defining moments
- Add more Anchors: Guild leaders, faction heads
- Duration: 2-3 hours

**Tier 3+ (Levels 11-16): City → Capital**
- **Switch to full Microscope** for regional/world context
- Use Chronicle for specific buildings/organizations within city
- Chronicle = "The Grand Library" or "The Thieves' Guild"
- Duration: 2-4 hours

### Workflow Integration

**Option A: Session Zero**
- Run Chronicle to create initial settlement history
- Establishes tone, key NPCs, defining moments
- Players are invested from start

**Option B: Between Tiers**
- Players reach new tier → need larger settlement
- Run Chronicle session to create it
- 3-5 hour dedicated worldbuilding session

**Option C: Reactive**
- Players show interest in settlement's past
- "How did this place get so rich/poor/corrupt?"
- Run abbreviated Chronicle (1-2 hours, focus on key Periods)

### Handoffs to Other Systems

**Chronicle creates → Ex Novo details**
- Chronicle: "Founding Period - desperate refugees"
- Ex Novo: Places the districts, founding resources, first need

**Chronicle creates → Street Magic details**
- Chronicle Anchor: "Mara Ironwood, blacksmith founder"
- Street Magic Resident: Add true name, landmark, vignette

**Chronicle creates → BF&B details**
- Chronicle Event: "The guild establishes headquarters"
- BF&B: Generate the headquarters building with roles

**Chronicle creates → Ex Umbra hooks**
- Chronicle Event: "Ancient temple discovered, then sealed"
- Ex Umbra: Generate temple as rumor-based dungeon

## Key Modifications for Western Horizon

### 1. Abbreviated Chronicle for Speed

Instead of open-ended play:
- **Set Period target:** 3-5 Periods for small settlement, 5-8 for larger
- **Set Anchor target:** 1 Anchor per Period minimum
- **Time-box:** 2 hours for hamlet, 3 hours for town, 4 hours for city

### 2. "Current State" as END Bookend

The END bookend isn't the settlement's destruction—it's **where it is NOW** at campaign start:

**START:** "Founding - refugees flee burning kingdom" (Light/Dark?)
**END:** "Present Day - prosperous trade town, but tensions with neighboring city" (Light/Dark?)

Everything between is history. The "present" can change as campaign progresses.

### 3. Living Chronicle

Unlike typical Chronicle that ends after one session:
- Chronicle can be **reopened** at later tiers
- Add new Periods between existing ones
- Add new Anchors as NPCs emerge
- The END bookend shifts to new "Present Day"

**Example:**
- Tier 1: Create hamlet history, END = "Small frontier town"
- Tier 2: Reopen Chronicle, add Periods, new END = "Growing trade hub"
- Tier 3: Switch to full Microscope, Chronicle becomes part of larger world

### 4. Integrate with Palette

Use Chronicle's Palette step to also establish:
- **Campaign tone** (Yes: Political intrigue, No: Cosmic horror)
- **Safety tools** (Lines & Veils)
- **Player expectations** (Yes: Player-driven, No: Linear plot)

Palette serves double duty: history creation + Session Zero

## Chronicle vs. Full Microscope: When to Use Each

### Use Chronicle When:
- Creating a **single settlement's** history
- Players are **Tier 1-2** (local scope)
- Want **character-focused** history (Anchors)
- Need **tight focus** to avoid wandering
- Time-limited session (2-4 hours)

### Use Full Microscope When:
- Creating **world/regional** history
- Players are **Tier 3-4** (need broad context)
- Want **civilization-scale** events
- Session Zero for entire campaign
- Comfortable with 4-6 hour session

### Use Both When:
- Session Zero: Full Microscope for world → Chronicle for starting settlement
- Between tiers: Chronicle for new settlement within Microscope world
- Nested histories: World (Microscope) → City (Chronicle) → Building (BF&B) → NPC (Street Magic)

## Practical Example: Creating Millhaven

**Chronicle:** "Millhaven, frontier town turned trade hub"

**Bookends:**
- **START:** "Founding (20 years ago) - Desperate refugees flee the Burning of Westmarch" (Dark - loss and desperation)
- **END:** "Present Day - Prosperous crossroads town, but merchant princes scheme for control" (Light - prosperity, but tensions)

**First Pass Periods:**
- Player 1: "Early Struggle (15 years ago) - Harsh winters, disease, barely surviving"
- Player 2: "The Mill (12 years ago) - Water mill built, first real industry"
- Player 3: "Trade Routes (8 years ago) - Road established, merchants arrive"

**Second Pass Anchors:**
- Player 1: "Keth the Builder, carpenter who designed the first mill" (Period: The Mill)
- Player 2: "Sena Three-Coins, merchant who brokered the trade route" (Period: Trade Routes)
- Player 3: "Old Mara, one of the original refugees, now innkeeper" (Period: Founding)

**Later Rounds add Events:**
- Period "Early Struggle": Event "Keth loses his family to fever, pours grief into building" (Dark)
- Period "Trade Routes": Event "Sena negotiates with three cities simultaneously, opens Millhaven to all" (Light)

**Result after 2 hours:**
- 5-6 Periods spanning 20 years
- 5-8 Anchors (potential NPCs)
- 10-15 Events (major moments)
- Rich, player-created history
- Everyone is invested

**Handoffs:**
- Run Ex Novo to detail current districts
- Use Street Magic for The Mill and Sena's trading house
- Keth and Sena become resident NPCs
- Old Mara's inn is where guild posts quests

---

## Why This Works Better Than Pre-Generated History

**Traditional approach:** DM writes settlement history alone, players learn it later
**Chronicle approach:** Players CO-CREATE history, already know and care about it

**Benefits:**
- **Investment:** Players helped make it, they're attached
- **Shared ownership:** No "guessing what the DM wants"
- **Flexible:** Can add to history later as campaign needs change
- **Character-driven:** Anchors become NPCs players already care about
- **Emergent:** Surprises come from player contributions, not DM secrets

---

## The Tiered Approach Summary

**Tier 1-2 (Levels 1-10):**
- Chronicle for settlement history
- Scope: This place, these people
- Duration: 1-3 hours

**Tier 3+ (Levels 11+):**
- Full Microscope for world history
- Chronicle for specific locations within world
- Scope: Regional powers, neighboring cities, ancient history
- Duration: 3-6 hours for Microscope, 2-3 for Chronicle

**Session Zero:**
- Optional: Full Microscope for world (if desired)
- Chronicle for starting settlement (always)
- Palette serves both systems

---

## Key Takeaway

Chronicle is **THE primary history system** for Western Horizon at lower tiers. It's focused, fast enough for single session, creates character-driven history, and scales up naturally. Full Microscope comes in at higher tiers when the campaign's scope demands world-level context.

Start Chronicle → Add Periods as tiers increase → Switch to Microscope when world scope is needed → Use Chronicle again for specific locations within that world.
