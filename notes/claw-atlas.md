# Claw Atlas

> **Author:** Tyler Crumrine, Jonathan Yee, Austin Breed
> **Publisher:** Possible Worlds Games
> **Pages:** 16
> **Session Length:** Adds 15-30 minutes to BF&B session
> **Players:** Same as base Beak, Feather & Bone

## Overview

Expansion for Beak, Feather & Bone adding two major variants: **The Hunters** (faction actions create settlement-specific threats) and **The Mapmakers** (procedural map generation during play). Also includes new faction role (The Hunters) and additional maps.

## Role in The Western Horizon

**Primary Scale:** Settlement (same as BF&B)
**Used For:** Adding consequence/threat layer to settlements + zero-prep map generation
**Sections Updated:** `02-settlements.html` (Mapmakers), `06-threats.html` (Hunters)

## Why These Variants Matter for Western Horizon

### The Hunters: Consequences Not Random Encounters

**The Problem:** Most settlement generators create static locations. Monsters/threats feel bolted-on.

**The Solution:** The Hunters variant makes threats **emerge from faction actions**. The winning faction's dominant suit (most ♥/♦/♣/♠) determines what kind of action attracted/created the threat:

- **♥ Social:** Ritual, gathering, or mass worship attracted something
- **♦ Financial:** Greed, exploitation, or trade awakened/summoned threat
- **♣ Future:** Ambitious experiment or reckless preparation went wrong
- **♠ Past:** Disturbed ruins, broke seals, or stole artifacts

**For West Marches:**
- Every settlement gets unique, plot-integrated threat
- Different parties approach same threat differently based on factional alliances
- Threats don't feel "random"—they're consequences of political choices made during settlement generation

### The Mapmakers: True Zero-Prep

**The Problem:** Finding/preparing settlement maps takes time and limits spontaneity.

**The Solution:** Generate the map AS you play through either:

**Method 1: Drawing** - Card values dictate geometric shapes
- Aces = draw suit symbol (♥♦♣♠)
- 2 = shape with 2 parallel lines
- 3-10 = shape with that many sides
- Jack = must be adjacent to existing shape
- Queen = must be isolated from all shapes
- King = must envelop another shape

**Method 2: Collaging** - Cut shapes from any source and paste onto blank sheet

**Why face cards are genius:** Jack/Queen/King create **meaningful spatial relationships**:
- **Jacks cluster** → Market districts, guild quarters, connected compounds
- **Queens isolate** → Watchtowers, quarantine zones, noble estates, mysterious structures
- **Kings nest** → Fortified temples, walled gardens, prisons, containment

**For West Marches:**
- Party discovers settlement mid-session → Generate map on the fly
- No map library needed
- Geography tells story through pure procedure

## Core Mechanics Worth Extracting

### The Faction-Threat Matrix

The Hunters variant creates a decision tree: **Faction Type × Dominant Suit = Threat Type**

Example combinations:
- **Miners + ♦ (Financial):** "Dug too deep seeking rare ore, broke into sealed vault"
- **Mages + ♣ (Future):** "Experimental summoning ritual miscalculated parameters"
- **Clerics + ♥ (Social):** "Mass festival attracted entity that feeds on devotion"
- **Strangers + ♠ (Past):** "Outsiders brought knowledge of ancient enemy"

**Monster generation is collaborative:**
1. Winner describes the ACTION that caused it
2. Everyone else contributes one element of the THREAT (appearance, behavior, motivation, weakness)

**Use in WH:** Every settlement generation can optionally include immediate adventure hook tied to faction politics.

### Spatial Meaning from Card Rules

The Mapmakers' face card rules create geography that **means something**:

**Adjacent (Jack):**
- Physically connected buildings suggest relationship
- Shared walls, mutual defense, co-dependent functions
- "The thieves' guild and the merchant quarter share a warehouse district"

**Isolated (Queen):**
- Distance suggests danger, exclusivity, or mystery
- Quarantine, social separation, forbidden knowledge
- "The Strangers' observatory sits alone on the crater rim, far from other structures"

**Enveloping (King):**
- Containment suggests protection or imprisonment
- Nested structures show hierarchy, secrecy, or danger management
- "The Clerics' temple contains a sealed inner sanctum that no one enters"

**Use in WH:** Apply these spatial meanings even without using Mapmakers. When placing buildings, ask: "Should this be adjacent, isolated, or nested?"

## Key Procedures

### The Hunters Variant (Threat Generation)

**When to use:** After any BF&B settlement generation when you want immediate adventure hook
**Duration:** 15 minutes after BF&B session
**Output:** Settlement-specific threat with clear cause

**Steps:**
1. During BF&B, track not just card VALUES (for Seat of Power) but also SUIT TOTALS per faction
2. Example: Mages draw 3♥, J♠, 2♦, 7♥ → Suit totals: 10♥, 0♠, 2♦ (card total: 12)
3. Determine Seat of Power as normal (highest card value wins)
4. Look at winner's suit totals—**highest suit** is the catalyst
5. Winner describes what ACTION their faction took (based on that suit)
6. Other players collaboratively describe the MONSTER/THREAT that resulted
7. Each non-winner contributes at least one element (appearance, behavior, ability, weakness, connection to action)

**Result:** Unique threat that makes narrative sense, immediate plot hook, faction accountability.

### The Mapmakers Variant (Procedural Generation)

**When to use:** No time to prep map, want organic emergence, zero-prep session
**Duration:** Same as normal BF&B (map grows as you play)
**Output:** Unique map with meaningful spatial relationships

**Method A: Drawing**
1. Start with blank sheet
2. When claiming building, draw shape based on card (see rules above)
3. Place anywhere on sheet (except face cards have restrictions)
4. Color, label, describe as normal

**Method B: Collaging**
1. Start with blank sheet + source material (old maps, magazines, any images)
2. When claiming building, cut shape from source
3. Paste anywhere on sheet
4. Describe as normal

**Optimization:** Distribute collage sources to all players so they cut during others' turns.

**Result:** Zero-prep map that tells spatial story through procedure.

### Combined Variant (Hunters + Mapmakers)

**When to use:** Maximum improvisation—no prep, immediate adventure hook
**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Output:** Complete settlement package (map + factions + threat)

**Steps:**
1. Use Mapmakers to generate map during play
2. Track suit totals as you go
3. End with Hunters variant threat generation
4. Spatial relationships on map inform monster behavior

**Example:** Queen card isolated a building → That becomes the monster's lair
**Example:** King card nested a structure → Monster is contained there (for now)

**Result:** Settlement map, political structure, and adventure seed all generated in single session with zero prep.

## Integration Notes

### Inputs (What These Variants Need)

**The Hunters:**
- Completed BF&B settlement generation
- Suit totals tracked during play
- Willingness for collaborative monster design

**The Mapmakers:**
- Blank sheet of paper
- Drawing implements OR collage source material
- Comfort with improvisation/abstract representation

### Outputs (What These Variants Produce)

**The Hunters:**
- Settlement-specific threat/monster
- Clear cause-and-effect (faction action → consequence)
- Immediate adventure hook
- Optional: Monster stat block (generated separately using your system)

**The Mapmakers:**
- Physical map with unique layout
- Spatial relationships that create meaning
- Beautiful artifact (especially with collaging)

### Handoff To

**From Hunters:**
- **Bestiary/Monster Generation:** Take collaborative description and stat it
- **Quest System:** Threat becomes multi-session arc
- **Faction System:** Defeating threat shifts power balance

**From Mapmakers:**
- **Street Magic:** Use generated districts as neighborhoods to detail further
- **Hex Mapping:** Settlement map placement within regional hex

### Conflicts & Resolutions

**Conflict:** Mapmakers can create "unrealistic" geography (isolated buildings in city center, etc.)

**Resolution:** Embrace it. Ask "Why is this isolated?" Creates mystery. Unrealistic = story opportunity.

**Conflict:** Hunters might generate threat too powerful/inappropriate for party level

**Resolution:** Threat doesn't need immediate resolution. Can be campaign-long arc. Or: scale to party during statting phase.

## Adaptation Notes

### Modifications for WH

**Hunters Scaling:**
- **Quick mode:** Generate threat but don't stat it immediately—just describe conceptually
- **Full mode:** Stat threat using WH's monster generation system
- **Campaign mode:** Track multiple settlement threats on regional map; unresolved threats escalate

**Mapmakers Flexibility:**
- **Abstract mode:** Skip actual drawing, just track spatial relationships (list: "adjacent to...", "isolated", "contains...")
- **Hybrid mode:** Use pre-made map outline, players add detail through drawing/collaging

**New Faction (The Hunters - Role XI):**
- Add to terrain-based faction lists for wilderness-adjacent settlements
- Focus: Protection from external threats, wilderness survival, tracking
- Often in tension with expansionist factions (Miners, Farmers, Ranchers)

## Quick Reference
