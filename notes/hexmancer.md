# Hexmancer Notes (Optional Appendix)

**System:** Hexmancer v1.2
**Author:** Martin Ralya (Traverse Fantasy)
**Status:** Optional hexcrawl supplement - NOT core to WH

---

## Why Hexmancer Isn't Core to Western Horizon

### The Fundamental Mismatch

**Hexmancer's model:** Players wander hex-by-hex, generating terrain procedurally as they explore unknown wilderness

**Western Horizon's model:** Players declare destinations ("We're investigating the Thornwood Temple"), DM preps that specific location

**The problem:** WH doesn't need procedural hex generation because:
1. Players post **quest intent**, not "we wander northwest"
2. Travel is often **abstracted** ("three days pass...")
3. Content focuses on **destinations** (dungeons, settlements), not journey

---

## When Hexmancer MIGHT Be Useful

### Limited Use Cases

**Hexcrawl Mode (Optional):**
If your table wants detailed exploration where the journey IS the content, Hexmancer provides:
- Terrain continuity (50% same terrain continues = natural regions)
- Feature density scaling (Wilderness 8% → Settled 21%)
- Roads/trails/rivers that create adventure threads

**Random Waypoint Seeding:**
Use the d20 feature table to quickly generate discoveries during travel:
- Roll when Travel Complications gives "Major Discovery"
- Wizard tower (11-12), Temple (13-14), Castle (15-17) become waypoints
- Hand off to Street Magic for detailing

---

## What Western Horizon Actually Needs Instead

### Travel & Journeys (Part III - Actual Content)

**Complications:** Things that happen between quest sites
- Blocked routes, hostile encounters, getting lost
- Environmental hazards, resource depletion
- Social encounters, omens, discoveries

**Waypoints:** Quick landmark generation for stops
- d12 waypoint types (inn, shrine, ruins, natural feature)
- Street Magic "true name" for memorability
- Seed future content

**Encounters:** Purposeful travel NPCs
- d12 encounter types (bandits, refugees, merchants, pilgrims)
- Quick NPC generation (30-second method)
- Every encounter offers info, choice, or future hook

**Weather:** Atmosphere and complications
- d12 weather conditions
- Effects on travel and mood

## If You Want Hexcrawl Mode

### Hexmancer Tables (Appendix Only)

Keep the three-dice method in an appendix:
- **d30:** Terrain generation (influenced by adjacent hex)
- **d24:** Feature presence (by region type: Wilderness/Borderlands/Settled)
- **d20:** Feature type (ruins, roads, structures, villages)

**Byways and Waterways:** Special rules for roads/trails/rivers that span multiple hexes

**When to use:** Only if your group says "we want to explore the wilderness hex-by-hex" rather than "we're going to Location X"

---

## Recommendation

**Move Hexmancer to Appendix B** with note:
> "Most Western Horizon campaigns focus on quest destinations rather than hex-by-hex exploration. If your table prefers detailed wilderness hexcrawling, use these Hexmancer procedures. Otherwise, use the Travel & Journeys content in Part III."

**Replace Part III** with destination-focused travel:
- When to montage vs. zoom in
- Complications table (d20)
- Waypoints table (d12)
- Encounters table (d12)
- Weather table (d12)
- Travel times by terrain

This aligns with WH's reactive, destination-focused philosophy.
