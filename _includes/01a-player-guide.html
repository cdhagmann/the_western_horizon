    <h2>What Makes This Different</h2>

    <p>If you've played D&D or other TTRPGs before, this campaign works differently in some important ways. Understanding these differences will help you get the most out of play.</p>

    <h3>The Inversion: You Drive, We React</h3>

    <p><strong>Traditional Play:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>GM creates hooks → Players choose → GM runs prepared content</li>
        <li>"What do you want to do?" often means "which of my planned options do you pick?"</li>
        <li>Story comes to you through GM-authored plot</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Western Horizon Play:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Players declare goals → GM creates obstacles → Players pursue goals</li>
        <li>"What do you want to do?" means exactly what it says</li>
        <li>Story emerges from your goals colliding with faction goals</li>
    </ul>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Traditional Expectation</th>
                <th>Western Horizon Reality</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr><td>Wait for hooks to appear</td><td>Bring goals to the table</td></tr>
            <tr><td>React to GM's story</td><td>Author your character's story</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Guess what the GM wants</td><td>Say what you want</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Choose between options</td><td>Create your own options</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Adventure finds you</td><td>You find adventure</td></tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">This Is Liberating, Not Limiting</div>
        <p>You're not guessing what the GM prepped. You're not constrained to "obvious" choices. If you want to find the assassin who killed your mentor, investigate corruption in the merchant's guild, or establish a trade route with the nomads—say so. That's what generates content.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Open Table: Show Up When You Want</h3>

    <p><strong>How scheduling works:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Player posts: "I want to [goal]. Who's in? Need a DM for [date/time]."</li>
        <li>Other players sign up (or don't—no guilt)</li>
        <li>A DM claims it</li>
        <li>That group plays that session</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>No fixed party composition</li>
        <li>No expectation you'll attend every session</li>
        <li>No "main storyline" that requires continuity</li>
        <li>Multiple groups can play simultaneously in the same world</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Living World: It Always Existed</h3>

    <p>When you discover something—a ruined temple, a merchant prince, a hidden faction—it becomes <strong>permanent canon</strong>. It gets logged in the Guild wiki as something "the Guild always knew about" (even though we just created it).</p>

    <p><strong>What this means:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can reference discoveries from other groups' sessions</li>
        <li>NPCs remember past interactions (even with different players)</li>
        <li>The world grows session by session</li>
        <li>Your actions have lasting consequences</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Collaborative Creation: We Build Together</h3>

    <p>You're not just consuming content the GM created. At multiple points, you'll participate in worldbuilding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Everyone builds history and the starting settlement together</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement Building:</strong> When reaching new tiers, we play collaborative games to create towns</li>
        <li><strong>Rumor Tables:</strong> Your speculation about dungeons influences what's actually there</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> When you find something new, you help name it and describe it</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="player-role">
    <h2>Your Role as a Player</h2>

    <h3>Primary Responsibility: Bring Goals</h3>

    <p>The most important thing you do as a player is <strong>maintain goals for your character</strong>. Without player goals, the campaign has no direction. With them, everything flows naturally.</p>

    <p><strong>The three-goal framework:</strong> Each character should have three goals at any given time:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Goal Type</th>
                <th>Time Horizon</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Short-term</strong></td>
                <td>1-3 sessions</td>
                <td>"Find the moss in the Thornwood for the alchemist"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Medium-term</strong></td>
                <td>3-10 sessions</td>
                <td>"Discover who's behind the disappearances"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Long-term</strong></td>
                <td>Campaign arc</td>
                <td>"Restore my family's honor and reclaim our ancestral estate"</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>As you complete goals, you create new ones. This is a continuous process, not just a Session Zero activity.</p>

    <h3>Secondary Responsibilities</h3>

    <h4>Communicate Your Intent</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Post in the group chat when you want to play</li>
        <li>Say what goal you're pursuing</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other players</li>
        <li>Claim a session or join one someone else posted</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Respect the Canon</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>What's established is real and persistent</li>
        <li>Don't contradict what's in the wiki</li>
        <li>Build on discoveries, don't ignore them</li>
        <li>Update the wiki with your discoveries</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Be Proactive in Play</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't wait for the DM to offer options</li>
        <li>Declare actions confidently</li>
        <li>Ask for what you need</li>
        <li>Use creative solutions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">What's NOT Expected</div>
        <p>You don't need to: attend every session, always have a plan, play the "right" character type, maintain party composition, wait for the DM to tell you what to do, know everything in the wiki, or figure out the "correct" solution.</p>
    </div>

<section id="character-creation">
    <h2>Creating Your Character</h2>

    <p>Character creation in The Western Horizon starts with goals, not stats. Design your character around what they want, not just what they can do.</p>

    <h3>Step 1: Generate Your Goals</h3>

    <p>Before you open the Player's Handbook, answer these questions:</p>

    <p><strong>For your short-term goal:</strong> What can my character accomplish in 1-3 sessions? What would be a satisfying immediate victory? What would failing this goal cost me?</p>

    <p><strong>For your medium-term goal:</strong> What am I building toward over multiple sessions? How does this connect to the world we're creating? Who might oppose this goal?</p>

    <p><strong>For your long-term goal:</strong> What would allow my character to retire satisfied? How does this tie to my character's core identity? What would make pursuing this goal fun for years?</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">The Magic Question</div>
        <p>For each goal, ask yourself: <em>"What would it look like when I reach this goal?"</em> Envision the scene: Where are you? Who's there? What just happened? How do you feel? This vision helps you and the DM create specific, achievable endpoints.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Goal Quality Checklist</h3>

    <p>Good goals have these properties:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Player-authored</strong> — YOU invented it (not suggested by the DM)</li>
        <li><strong>Specific endpoint</strong> — "Win the tournament" not "get stronger"</li>
        <li><strong>Clear consequences</strong> — You know what happens if you fail</li>
        <li><strong>Non-repeatable</strong> — Can't just try again next week</li>
        <li><strong>Fun to pursue</strong> — You can imagine interesting obstacles</li>
        <li><strong>Connected to character</strong> — Relates to who they are</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Bad Goal Example</div>
        <p>"I want to become more powerful so I can protect people."</p>
        <p>Why it's bad: Vague endpoint (when are you "powerful enough"?), no specific consequences for failure, repeatable (just keep leveling), generic (could apply to any character).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout success">
        <div class="callout-title">Good Goal Example</div>
        <p>"I want to win the Grand Tournament in Songul so Su-Li will agree to marry me, but if I lose, her family will betroth her to Lord Ravencroft instead."</p>
        <p>Why it's good: Specific endpoint (win the tournament), clear consequences (Su-Li marries someone else if you fail), non-repeatable (the tournament happens once), fun to pursue (training, rivals, intrigue), connected to character (reveals who they love and what they'll risk).</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Step 2: Design Your Character Backward</h3>

    <p>Now that you have goals, design a character who would reasonably pursue them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What class/abilities would help me pursue these goals?</li>
        <li>What background explains why I care about these goals?</li>
        <li>What relationships do I have that connect to these goals?</li>
        <li>What personality traits drive me toward these goals?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is the <em>opposite</em> of traditional character creation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Pick class → invent personality → find motivation</li>
        <li><strong>Western Horizon:</strong> Envision goals → design character who'd pursue them → select mechanics that fit</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Fill Out the Character Creation Form</h3>

    <p>Use the Character Creation Form to capture:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>High concept:</strong> One-sentence summary</li>
        <li><strong>Previous life:</strong> What they did before becoming an adventurer</li>
        <li><strong>Destiny/Bond:</strong> Why they adventure (maps to your long-term goal)</li>
        <li><strong>Trouble/Flaw:</strong> What causes problems</li>
        <li><strong>NPCs to Establish:</strong> People the DM needs to know about</li>
        <li><strong>Fear/Hate Buttons:</strong> Things that make your character act irrationally</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Connect Goals to the World</h3>

    <p>Your goals should intersect with factions, locations, other PCs, and the Guild. During character creation, ask:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which faction cares about my goals (positively or negatively)?</li>
        <li>Which locations would I need to visit?</li>
        <li>Do any other PCs have overlapping goals?</li>
        <li>How does the Guild help or hinder me?</li>
    </ul>

<section id="between-sessions">
    <h2>Between Sessions: The Rhythm of Play</h2>

    <p>The Western Horizon has a specific rhythm that's different from traditional campaigns.</p>

    <h3>The Planning Phase</h3>

    <p>This happens in Discord/your communication platform:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Someone Posts Intent:</strong> "I want to investigate those ruins we heard about. Looking for the Ember Stone. Who's in?"</li>
        <li><strong>Others Respond:</strong> "I'm in—my character needs information about ancient magic" or "Can't make it this week!"</li>
        <li><strong>A DM Claims It:</strong> "I'll run this. Give me 2-3 days to prep."</li>
        <li><strong>Party Forms:</strong> First 3-5 interested players get slots. Party doesn't need to be "balanced."</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The GM Prep Phase</h3>

    <p>The DM uses the generation systems to create content responsive to your declared goal. Your role: answer any questions the DM has, provide context about your goal if needed, don't backseat-DM, and trust the generation systems.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">How Much Prep Time?</div>
        <ul>
            <li>Simple expeditions (revisiting known locations): 1-2 days</li>
            <li>Complex generation (new dungeons, major sites): 3-5 days</li>
            <li>Significant world additions (new settlements): Might need a building session first</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>The Wiki Reference Phase</h3>

    <p>Before your session, check the Guild Wiki for what's already known about your destination, relevant faction activities, NPCs who might be involved, and previous expedition reports. You don't need to memorize everything—5-10 minutes of skimming relevant pages is plenty.</p>
</section>

<section id="during-expeditions">
    <h2>During Expeditions: What to Expect</h2>

    <h3>You Start Already Committed</h3>

    <p><strong>Traditional opening:</strong> "You're all in a tavern. A hooded figure approaches..."</p>
    <p><strong>Western Horizon opening:</strong> "You're three hours into the Thornwood. The path has narrowed, and you can hear running water ahead. What do you do?"</p>

    <p>Because you already declared your intent in the planning phase, sessions start in medias res. No "talking in circles at the tavern"—you get to the interesting content faster.</p>

    <h3>Your Actions Drive the Scene</h3>

    <p>You're not trying to find the "correct" solution or guess what content the DM prepared. You're declaring actions that make sense for your character's approach and goals.</p>

    <p><strong>Examples of proactive play:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>"I want to intimidate the guard by telling him I work for the Merchant's Guild"</li>
        <li>"Can I use my knowledge of architecture to spot structural weaknesses?"</li>
        <li>"I'm going to try to befriend the barmaid to learn about local politics"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Failure Creates Opportunities</h3>

    <p>When you fail a check or make a bad decision, interesting things happen. Failures advance the story just as much as successes. They create complications, reveal new information, and open unexpected paths. Embrace them.</p>

    <h3>NPCs Have Goals Too</h3>

    <p>Every significant NPC is part of a faction with goals. They're not just quest-givers—they're pursuing their own objectives. Ask NPCs what they want, propose mutually beneficial arrangements, and consider faction politics.</p>

    <h3>The World Reacts Between Sessions</h3>

    <p>When your session ends, the world doesn't freeze. Faction clocks advance. NPCs act on information you revealed. If you leave a threat unresolved, it might get worse. If you help a faction, they remember.</p>

<section id="common-pitfalls">
    <h2>Common Pitfalls (And How to Avoid Them)</h2>

    <h3>"I Don't Know What My Character Wants"</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You wait for the GM to offer hooks, defer to other players' goals, or sessions feel directionless.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Review your three goals—are they specific enough? Ask in chat: "My character wants X. What would that look like?" Use the bulletin board for inspiration. Talk to other players—maybe you can attach to their goals.</p>

    <h3>"I'm Waiting for the Right Moment"</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You hold back in sessions, let other players lead, aren't sure when to speak up.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Just do it. There's no "right moment" in proactive play. If you want to examine something, examine it. The worst that happens is the DM says "okay, how?" and you figure it out together.</p>

    <h3>"I Don't Want to Step on the DM's Toes"</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You avoid suggesting things, ask permission for normal actions, worry about "ruining" the DM's plans.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The DM has no plans for you to ruin. They have obstacles, not storylines. By being proactive, you're not making their job harder—you're making it easier.</p>

    <h3>"The Other Players Are Doing All the Cool Stuff"</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> You feel overshadowed, your goals seem less interesting, you default to support role.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure your goals are as compelling as theirs—revise if needed. Find intersection points. Post your own session intent instead of only joining others. In an open table, different characters shine in different sessions.</p>
