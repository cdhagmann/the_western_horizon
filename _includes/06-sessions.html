    <h2>VI. At the Table — Running Sessions</h2>

    <p>Western Horizon sessions are <strong>self-contained expeditions</strong>. A player posts intent, the GM preps the quest site, the party ventures out, engages with the content, and returns. Most sessions resolve in a single sitting. A few—especially near tier boundaries—stretch across two.</p>

    <p>Regardless of length, every expedition follows the same underlying structure.</p>

    <h3>The Five Room Structure</h3>

    <p>Every quest site—whether it's a literal dungeon, a bandit camp, a political negotiation, or an herb garden—follows the same five-beat arc. These aren't rooms in the architectural sense. They're <strong>scenes</strong>: self-contained moments that build toward a satisfying conclusion.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Structure Invites Creativity</div>
        <p>The five room structure isn't a cage—it's a scaffold. It guarantees your session has pacing, variety, and a satisfying arc without requiring you to plan a novel. You can prep a complete session in under an hour using this framework, and experienced GMs can improvise one on the fly.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>The Resolution Seeds the World</h4>

    <p>Beat 5 is where the expedition feeds back into the wider campaign. The resolution should include <strong>at least one</strong> of these:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A discovery for the tavern map:</strong> A map fragment, a vista revealing distant landmarks, a journal mentioning a location</li>
        <li><strong>Intelligence about a faction:</strong> Evidence of their plans, a captured NPC who talks, supplies stamped with a crest</li>
        <li><strong>A hook tied to another PC's goals:</strong> The herbalist's party finds mining equipment in the crypt—the priest's player perks up at debrief</li>
        <li><strong>A Tetris piece for later:</strong> A name, a symbol, an unanswered question you pocket for when it becomes relevant three months from now</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Example: Five Rooms Without a Dungeon</div>
        <p>The herbalist posts intent: <em>"I want to investigate the silvervein moss garden Party A spotted near the Thornwood."</em></p>
        <p><strong>Entrance:</strong> The creek is swollen from recent rains. The obvious path is flooded—find another way across or risk the current.</p>
        <p><strong>Puzzle:</strong> Silvervein moss only grows in specific conditions. The garden is spread across several banks—figuring out which ones are viable requires knowledge checks and careful observation.</p>
        <p><strong>Setback:</strong> Someone else is already here. A rival apothecary from the next settlement over, with hired guards, harvesting aggressively. Or: something is <em>protecting</em> the garden—a territorial creature that considers the moss its territory.</p>
        <p><strong>Climax:</strong> Confrontation. Negotiate with the rival, fight the creature, or find a creative third option. The herbalist's specific skills matter here.</p>
        <p><strong>Resolution:</strong> The moss is secured—but the garden is dying. Something upstream is poisoning the water. A new hex, a new question, a new quest intent waiting to be posted.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Beats 1 and 2 Are Swappable</div>
        <p>The entrance and puzzle can trade places freely. Starting with a puzzle ("the door is sealed, solve the riddle") followed by combat ("a guardian attacks once you're inside") works just as well. Pick whatever creates the best opening energy for your table.</p>

<section id="session-expeditions">
    <h3>Expedition Types</h3>

    <p>Most Western Horizon sessions are <strong>day trips</strong>—out and back in a single session. But some quests justify a longer format. There are three expedition types:</p>

    <h4>Day Trip (Default — One Session)</h4>

    <p>The standard expedition. The party departs, reaches the quest site, runs through five beats, and returns to the settlement. This is the bread and butter of WH play.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Travel is typically montaged or handled with a single complication</li>
        <li>The five room structure fills the session</li>
        <li>Debrief happens at session end or asynchronously afterward</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Overnight Expedition (Two Sessions)</h4>

    <p>Some quests are too far, too complex, or too significant to resolve in one sitting. Overnight expeditions split across two sessions with a <strong>camp scene</strong> in between.</p>

    <p><strong>Session One</strong> covers the journey and the first 2-3 beats of the five room structure. The session ends with the party making camp—either partway through the quest site or en route to a distant destination.</p>

    <p><strong>The Camp Scene</strong> is where overnight expeditions earn their keep. Characters pair off for watch rotations. Quiet conversations happen. The GM describes the night—stars, sounds, weather, the feeling of being far from the settlement. This is where character relationships deepen and the world becomes atmospheric in a way that day trips don't allow.</p>

    <p><strong>Session Two</strong> picks up the remaining beats and concludes the expedition. The party is already committed—resources partially spent, no easy retreat. The climax carries more weight because they've invested two sessions to reach it.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Camp Scenes in Practice</div>
        <p>During camp, each pair of watch characters gets a brief scene—two to five minutes of in-character conversation. The GM can use the quiet moments to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Describe the environment in detail (atmosphere, not exposition)</li>
            <li>Drop a subtle omen or sign related to the quest ahead</li>
            <li>Let characters process what's happened so far</li>
            <li>Create a seeded discovery moment—something noticed in the dark</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Keep it brief. The camp scene is seasoning, not the main course.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Expeditions & Tier Boundaries</h4>

    <p>Tier boundary quests should almost always be overnight expeditions. These aren't just the hardest quests on the map—they're the <strong>one thing left undone</strong>. The loose end that's been nagging at the character. The garden they never got to explore, the shrine they always meant to consecrate, the fugitive who slipped away three sessions ago. Every character has that thing they'd regret leaving behind.</p>

    <p>When a player looks at their mostly-full personal hex map and says <em>"Before I move on, I need to..."</em>—that's a tier boundary expedition. It's personal, it's chosen, and it closes the chapter.</p>

    <p>An overnight tier boundary expedition might look like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session One:</strong> Journey to the furthest unresolved hex on the character's personal map. Travel complications are more serious—this is the edge of what they know. First beats of the quest site establish the stakes.</li>
        <li><strong>Camp Scene:</strong> The character reflects on how far they've come. Paired watch conversations touch on goals achieved, things left behind, what comes next. The GM seeds the transition—what lies beyond this frontier.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Two:</strong> The climax and resolution. When it's done, the character's map is essentially full. They return to the settlement with a choice: move on to a larger frontier, or stay. Either way, their story in this place has a final chapter.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Why Tier Boundaries Need Two Sessions</div>
        <p>A character's transition from one tier to the next is the end of a chapter in their story. Compressing that into a single session undersells it. The overnight format gives the moment room to breathe—room for atmosphere, reflection, and the sense that this quest <em>cost</em> something. You earn the right to retire or move on because the final expedition demanded it.</p>
