    <h2>II. Settlements on the Horizon</h2>

    <p>Settlements in Western Horizon are <strong>living palimpsests</strong>—layered documents where history is visible in the present. They're generated responsively when players declare intent to visit or establish a new location, using a combination of geographic foundation, factional dynamics, and historical events.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Settlements as Story Engines</div>
        <p>A settlement isn't just geography—it's <strong>contested space</strong> where factions compete for resources and power. Every landmark tells a story. Every district bears historical scars. The map itself becomes a visual timeline that generates adventure hooks organically.</p>

    <h3>Settlement Creation Modes</h3>
    
    <p>Western Horizon supports three settlement creation modes, scalable by time and detail needs:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Mode</th>
                <th>Duration</th>

        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Quick</strong></td>
                <td>5-15 min</td>
                <td>Background settlements, mid-session discovery</td>
                <td>Geography + founding resource + 2 factions + name</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>30-60 min</td>
                <td>Notable towns, between-session prep</td>
                <td>Founding Phase + 3-5 historical events + key landmarks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Full</strong></td>
                <td>90-120 min</td>
                <td>Session zero hometown, campaign hub</td>
                <td>Complete Ex Novo generation with development phase</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Partial Definition is Intentional</div>
        <p>Even "full" settlements leave 50-70% undefined. Blank spaces aren't failures—they're <strong>breathing room</strong> for future development. Ex Novo's philosophy: settlements are <strong>frameworks</strong>, not comprehensive simulations. The undefined spaces invite player-driven discovery.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Who Participates</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick Mode:</strong> DM alone (5 min between sessions)</li>
        <li><strong>Medium Mode:</strong> DM + interested players (async in Discord or live prep)</li>
        <li><strong>Full Mode:</strong> Whole table as session zero activity (collaborative worldbuilding)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Essential Output</h4>
    <p>Every settlement generation should produce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✓ <strong>Geographic foundation</strong> (terrain type, major features, founding resource)</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>2-5 active factions</strong> with power relationships</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>Settlement name</strong> (and optional secondary/local name)</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>3-8 historical events</strong> (scaled to tier) that explain current state</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>Hand-drawn map</strong> showing districts, landmarks, resources</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>Timeline</strong> of formative events</li>
        <li>✓ <strong>Notable landmarks</strong> (at least 1 per faction)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">The Map is Your Primary Artifact</div>
        <p>Don't spend hours on elaborate keyed locations. The <strong>hand-drawn map</strong> with labeled districts and landmarks is your working document. It shows spatial relationships, faction territories, and historical layers at a glance. Detailed location descriptions come later through BF&B and Street Magic when players actually visit.</p>

    <h3>Founding: Why This Place Exists</h3>
    
    <p>Every settlement begins with <strong>geography and purpose</strong>. The terrain explains why people would settle here, and the founding resource explains what keeps them here. This foundation shapes everything that follows.</p>

    <h4>Geographic Foundation (Major Terrain)</h4>
    <p>Start with the landscape. Roll on the <strong>Terrain–Geography</strong> table (Ex Novo p. 36) or choose based on regional context:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>

                <td><strong>Island</strong></td>

    </table>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Draw the Terrain Shape</div>
        <p>On your settlement map, sketch the major terrain feature covering about a quarter to a third of the space. For rivers, draw the water; for mountains, sketch peaks; for coasts, show the shoreline. This isn't about art—it's about establishing spatial relationships.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Terrain Features (Add Topographic Detail)</h4>
    <p>Roll 4 times on the <strong>Terrain–Features</strong> table (Ex Novo p. 37) to add specific geographic elements. Each feature should be drawn on the map and named:</p>

    <p><strong>Common Features:</strong> Rivers, lakes, forests, hills, cliffs, caves, springs, marshes, ravines, rocky outcrops</p>

    <div class="procedure">
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>For Each Feature:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Roll or choose</strong> a terrain feature type</li>
                <li><strong>Draw it</strong> on the map in a logical location</li>
                <li><strong>Name it</strong> (collaborate with players if present)</li>
                <li><strong>Ask:</strong> "What makes this feature significant?"</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Rolling "river" → Draw a winding river through the map → Name it "The Serpent's Flow" → "It's called that because it changes course during spring floods, leaving abandoned channels like shed skin."</p>

    <h3>Factions: Power in Motion</h3>
    
    <p>Factions in Western Horizon are <strong>organized power structures</strong> competing for influence over resources, districts, and landmarks. They're not demographic categories—they're <strong>interpretive lenses</strong> that create meaning and conflict.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Factions as Dynamic Forces</div>
        <p>Ex Novo teaches us that factions aren't static. They rise and fall. They gain and lose power. They physically manifest through landmarks. Each faction has a symbol (for map iconography), a paradigm (their nature), and power tokens (their current influence). This concrete representation makes political maneuvering <em>visible</em> and <em>trackable</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Starting Factions (The First Two)</h4>

    <h4>Power Token Economy</h4>
    <p>Ex Novo uses a closed token economy to make faction influence <strong>concrete and zero-sum</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Growth Pool:</strong> Unallocated potential (starts with tokens based on settlement tier)</li>
        <li><strong>Faction Power:</strong> Influence over settlement decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Power:</strong> Control over key resources</li>
        <li><strong>Landmark Power:</strong> Physical manifestation of influence</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>When factions gain power:</strong> Tokens move from Growth Pool or other factions<br>
    <strong>When factions lose power:</strong> Tokens return to Growth Pool or move to rivals<br>
    <strong>When districts are destroyed:</strong> Population (citizens) returns to Growth Pool</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Tracking Power Digitally</div>
        <p>You don't need physical tokens. Use a settlement sheet with faction power listed numerically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Crystalline Order (Mages): 4 power</li>
            <li>Ironbound Warband (Soldiers): 3 power</li>
            <li>Merchants' Consortium: 2 power</li>
            <li>Growth Pool: 3 remaining</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Faction Landmarks</h4>
    <p>Each faction should have at least one landmark that physically represents their power. These become:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Social hubs:</strong> Where faction members gather</li>
        <li><strong>Power symbols:</strong> Visible reminders of influence</li>
        <li><strong>Quest locations:</strong> Sites for faction-specific missions</li>
        <li><strong>Combat zones:</strong> If faction conflict turns violent</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mages:</strong> The Crystalline Tower (research facility, library, arcane laboratory)</li>
        <li><strong>Soldiers:</strong> The Ironwall Barracks (training grounds, armory, headquarters)</li>
        <li><strong>Merchants:</strong> The Golden Scales (trading house, bank, auction hall)</li>
        <li><strong>Thieves:</strong> The Velvet Door (hidden tavern, black market, guild hall)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Factions Through Play</div>
        <p>Factions aren't static. As the campaign progresses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Historical events shift power (roll on Ex Novo event tables)</li>
            <li>Player actions support or undermine factions</li>
            <li>New factions emerge (upstarts, arrivals, schisms)</li>
            <li>Old factions collapse (losing all power tokens)</li>
            <li>The Seat of Power changes hands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Update faction power after each major arc. The settlement <em>evolves</em> with player choices.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>The Seat of Power</h4>
    <p>The faction with the most power tokens controls the settlement's primary authority. They:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control the most significant landmark (town hall, fortress, temple)</li>
        <li>Set settlement laws and priorities</li>
        <li>Provide the default authority figures (guards, officials, judges)</li>
        <li>Determine what's legal/illegal, valued/scorned</li>
        <li>React to threats and opportunities first</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Power Shifts:</strong> If another faction gains more tokens, the Seat of Power changes. This is a <strong>major campaign event</strong>—describe the transfer of authority, resistance from the old power, celebrations from the new.</p>

    <h3>Development: History Shapes the Present</h3>
    
    <p>Settlements gain depth through <strong>historical events</strong> that explain their current state.

                <li><strong>Interpret the prompt</strong> in the context of your settlement's existing elements</li>
                <li><strong>Perform the mechanical actions</strong> (add/remove districts, shift tokens, etc.)</li>
                <li><strong>Update the map</strong> to reflect physical changes</li>

    <h4>Example Event Integration</h4>
    <p><strong>Event Rolled:</strong> "A devastating plague strikes" (Natural Disaster category)</p>

    <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> "The Red Fever swept through the harbor district during a humid summer, brought by foreign traders. The Merchants' Guild tried to suppress news of it, and by the time the Clerics could quarantine, half the district was infected."</p>

    <p><strong>Mechanical Consequences:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Harbor district <strong>destroyed</strong> (remove from map, mark as ruins)</li>
        <li>Merchants' Guild <strong>loses 2 power</strong> (moved to Clerics for saving survivors)</li>
        <li>New landmark: <strong>The Fever Wall</strong> (quarantine boundary, still standing)</li>
        <li>Population decline: 1 citizen token returns to Growth Pool</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Adventure Hooks Created:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>What caused the fever? Natural disease or magical curse?</li>
        <li>The harbor ruins are unexplored—what valuables remain?</li>
        <li>Merchants lost power—are they plotting to regain it?</li>
        <li>Clerics gained authority—are they abusing it?</li>
        <li>Some survivors never left the quarantine zone—who are they now?</li>

    <h3>Districts: The City's Anatomy</h3>
    
    <p>Districts are the settlement's <strong>functional zones</strong>—residential, commercial, industrial, or specialized areas that hold population and define local character. They're abstract rather than precisely mapped, providing framework without over-detailing.</p>

    <h4>What is a Region/District?</h4>
    <p>Ex Novo divides settlements into <strong>regions</strong>—abstract spatial units defined by lines on your map. When a region is developed, it becomes a <strong>district</strong> with population and character.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Drawing Regions</div>
        <p>Use light pencil to divide your map into irregular areas. Don't worry about perfect boundaries—use natural features (rivers, hills) and organic shapes. Regions can be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Different sizes (variation is good)</li>
            <li>Circles, curves, or straight lines</li>
            <li>Bounded by terrain (riverbank, cliff edge, forest border)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Scale guidance:</strong> Each region represents roughly 0.5-2 km² depending on settlement size.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>District Types</h4>
    <p>When creating or expanding districts, consider these functional categories:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Function</th>
                <th>Common Buildings</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Residential</strong></td>
                <td>Where people live</td>
                <td>Houses, apartments, tenements, manors</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Commercial</strong></td>
                <td>Trade and services</td>
                <td>Markets, shops, taverns, inns, banks</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Industrial</strong></td>
                <td>Production and craft</td>
                <td>Workshops, forges, mills, warehouses</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Administrative</strong></td>
                <td>Governance and law</td>
                <td>Town hall, courts, guard posts, archives</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Religious</strong></td>
                <td>Worship and spirituality</td>
                <td>Temples, shrines, monasteries, graveyards</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Military</strong></td>
                <td>Defense and training</td>
                <td>Barracks, armories, walls, watchtowers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Cultural</strong></td>
                <td>Entertainment and gathering</td>
                <td>Theaters, parks, plazas, libraries</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Specialized</strong></td>
                <td>Unique to this settlement</td>
                <td>Wizard academy, gladiator arena, observatory</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>District Character</h4>
    <p>Beyond function, each district should have <strong>sensory identity</strong>. Use Street Magic principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sights:</strong> Building styles, colors, signage</li>
        <li><strong>Sounds:</strong> Ambient noise (hammers, music, crowds, silence)</li>
        <li><strong>Smells:</strong> Industry, cooking, flowers, sewage</li>
        <li><strong>Feel:</strong> Crowded vs. spacious, safe vs. dangerous</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>The Forge Quarter: blackened stone buildings, constant hammering and furnace roar, smell of hot metal and coal smoke, uncomfortably warm even in winter</em></p>

    <h4>Districts Through Time</h4>
    <p>Historical events create <strong>temporal layers</strong> in districts:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Founded:</strong> Original character from settlement founding</li>
        <li><strong>Expanded:</strong> Grown beyond original boundaries</li>
        <li><strong>Transformed:</strong> Major event changed its nature (fire, prosperity, invasion)</li>
        <li><strong>Abandoned:</strong> Disaster or depletion left it empty (becomes ♠ Past building source)</li>
        <li><strong>Reclaimed:</strong> Previously abandoned, now being rebuilt</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Abandoned Districts as Adventure Sites</div>
        <p>When an event destroys a district, don't erase it—mark it as <strong>ruins</strong>. These become instant dungeon sites:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collapsed buildings to explore</li>
            <li>Squatters or monsters move in</li>
            <li>Lost treasures/documents buried</li>
            <li>Faction efforts to reclaim or prevent reclamation</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Population & Density</h4>
    <p>Ex Novo uses <strong>citizen tokens</strong> to represent population abstractly. Use Ex Novo's density guidelines (p. 22) if you need concrete numbers:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>City Size</th>
                <th>Low Density</th>
                <th>Medium Density</th>
                <th>High Density</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Village</td>
                <td>100</td>
                <td>250</td>
                <td>500</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Town</td>
                <td>150</td>
                <td>500</td>
                <td>1,500</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Small City</td>
                <td>200</td>
                <td>1,000</td>
                <td>5,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Medium City</td>
                <td>350</td>
                <td>2,000</td>
                <td>10,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Large City</td>
                <td>600</td>
                <td>5,000</td>
                <td>25,000</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Metropolis</td>
                <td>1,500</td>
                <td>15,000</td>
                <td>100,000</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>But mostly:</strong> Don't worry about exact population. The number of districts and density feeling is sufficient for play.</p>

<section id="settlement-buildings">
    <h3>Notable Buildings</h3>
    
    <p>Buildings are defined through <strong>faction claiming</strong> and <strong>three-layer description</strong>—each location gets personality through reputation, appearance, and hidden truth. This can be done collaboratively (session zero) or by the DM (between sessions).</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Three-Layer Description</div>
        <p>Every building gets three sentences that create depth without overwhelming detail:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BEAK (Reputation):</strong> What do locals say? The rumor, the common knowledge</li>
            <li><strong>FEATHER (Appearance):</strong> What does it look like outside? Visual hooks for players</li>
            <li><strong>BONE (Reality):</strong> What's it really like inside? The truth, often contradicting the rumor</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This technique works for ANY location in Western Horizon—not just settlements.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">How Many Landmarks?</div>
        <p><strong>Session Zero/Full Generation:</strong> 2-3 per active faction (5-10 total)<br>
        <strong>Medium Generation:</strong> 1 per faction (3-5 total)<br>
        <strong>Quick Generation:</strong> Just faction headquarters (2 total)<br>
        <strong>During Play:</strong> Add more reactively as players explore</p>
    </div>

    <h4>The Landmark Procedure</h4>
    <p>Creating a landmark takes <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> of collaborative discussion. Each landmark needs three elements:</p>
    
    <div class="procedure">
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Title</h4>
            <p>What do locals call this place? The common name used in everyday conversation.</p>
            <p><em>Examples: The Gilt Rose Inn, Temple of Smoke and Mirrors, Margrave's Counting House, The Stormwatch Tower</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Address</h4>
            <p>Where is it within the district? This can be literal or poetic.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Literal:</strong> "17 Saltmarket Street, above the cobbler's"</li>
                <li><strong>Relative:</strong> "Three blocks from the fountain, near the old wall"</li>
                <li><strong>Poetic:</strong> "At the crossroads where the pilgrim trail ends"</li>
                <li><strong>Vertical:</strong> "Second story of the harbormaster's building" or "In the undercity, below the aqueduct"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The address helps establish <strong>spatial relationships</strong> between landmarks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>True Name</h4>
            <p>This is the <strong>sensory essence</strong> that makes the landmark unforgettable. Answer: <em>"What do you see, smell, hear, feel, or taste when you walk in?"</em></p>
            
            <div class="callout tip">
                <div class="callout-title">Creating True Names</div>
                <p>Close your eyes. Imagine walking into this place. What's the <strong>first thing you notice?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Gilt Rose Inn:</strong> "sawdust floors smell of pine, firelight dances on copper mugs, laughter from the kitchen"</li>
                    <li><strong>Temple of Smoke and Mirrors:</strong> "incense thick enough to taste, reflective obsidian walls, whispered prayers echo"</li>
                    <li><strong>The Counting House:</strong> "scratch of quills on parchment, smell of ink and dust, golden abacus clicks rhythmically"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>True names should be <strong>specific and evocative</strong>, not generic. They create immediate mental images and help the DM recall details during play.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Quick Landmark Creation</h4>
    <p>When you need a landmark <strong>right now</strong> (during session or quick prep):</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Title</strong> (30 seconds): First thing that comes to mind</li>
        <li><strong>Address</strong> (1 minute): How do you get there from somewhere players know?</li>
        <li><strong>True Name</strong> (2-3 minutes): Discuss sensory details until something clicks</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Building Purposes & Temporal Frames</h4>
    <p>Buildings serve different roles in the community across four temporal frames. When defining buildings, consider their relationship to time:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Frame</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Examples</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>♥ Social</strong></td>
                <td>Present community function</td>
                <td>Taverns, meeting halls, temples (active), parks, bathhouses, theaters</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>♦ Financial</strong></td>
                <td>Present economic role</td>
                <td>Markets, workshops, banks, warehouses, trading posts, merchant stalls</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>♣ Future</strong></td>
                <td>Preparation, aspiration</td>
                <td>Construction sites, academies, arsenals (building), research facilities, observatories</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>♠ Past</strong></td>
                <td>Historical, abandoned</td>
                <td>Ruins, sealed temples, old fortifications, forgotten monuments, empty manors</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Temporal Balance</div>
        <p>Settlements feel lived-in when they have buildings across all four frames:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>All Social/Financial, no Future/Past:</strong> Feels static, no sense of change</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Past:</strong> Settlement in decline, nostalgic tone</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Future:</strong> Growth/expansion focus, ambitious tone</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced:</strong> Settlement with history, present life, and aspirations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Use Past (♠) buildings as instant dungeon sites or mystery hooks.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Generating Rival NPCs</h4>
    <p>Some buildings automatically generate named NPCs through <strong>faction rivalry</strong>. When a building serves an important purpose (major landmark, Seat of Power candidate), create a rival from an opposing faction:</p>

    <div class="procedure">
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Identify the Opposition</h4>
            <p>Which faction would oppose this building's purpose? Use the natural conflict pairings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mages ↔ Clerics (reason vs. faith)</li>
                <li>Miners ↔ Farmers (extraction vs. cultivation)</li>
                <li>Soldiers ↔ Thieves (order vs. liberty)</li>
                <li>Merchants ↔ Elders (progress vs. tradition)</li>
                <li>Strangers ↔ Anyone (outsider vs. insider)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Create the Rival (Three Sentences)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BEAK:</strong> The rival's reputation in the community</li>
                <li><strong>FEATHER:</strong> The rival's appearance and mannerisms</li>
                <li><strong>BONE:</strong> The rival's true motivation (why they oppose this building)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong> The Mages control a research laboratory. The Clerics oppose it.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>BEAK:</strong> "Brother Aldus is known throughout town as a voice of moral clarity, warning against dangerous experiments."</li>
        <li><strong>FEATHER:</strong> "A stern, elderly cleric with ink-stained fingers from years of scholarly debate, always carrying a leather-bound tome."</li>
        <li><strong>BONE:</strong> "Once a mage himself, Aldus saw a ritual go wrong and kill his colleagues. He switched to the cloth to prevent others from making the same mistakes."</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Rivals Are Quest Fuel</div>
        <p>Each rival provides:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Named NPC with clear position</li>
            <li>Faction quest hook ("Help X against Y" or vice versa)</li>
            <li>Information source (rivals know secrets about each other)</li>
            <li>Investigation angle ("What's X really after?")</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Don't default to combat.</strong> Rivals create <em>political</em> opposition, not necessarily violent conflict.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Faction-Controlled Landmarks</h4>
    <p>Some landmarks represent faction power physically. When Ex Novo tells you to add a landmark for a faction, consider:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Faction Type</th>
                <th>Typical Landmarks</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Mages</strong></td>
                <td>Tower, library, laboratory, observatory, academy</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Miners</strong></td>
                <td>Mineshaft entrance, smelter, guild hall, ore storage</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Farmers</strong></td>
                <td>Granary, market, communal barn, festival grounds</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Soldiers</strong></td>
                <td>Barracks, armory, training yard, fortress, watchtower</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Merchants</strong></td>
                <td>Trading house, bank, warehouse, auction hall, market plaza</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Clerics</strong></td>
                <td>Temple, shrine, monastery, graveyard, healing house</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Thieves</strong></td>
                <td>Hidden tavern, gambling den, underground passage, fence shop</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Elders</strong></td>
                <td>Council hall, archives, ancestral estate, wisdom circle</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h4>Integration with Other Systems</h4>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>From Hexmancer Features</strong></summary>
        <div class="content-inner">
            <p>When Hexmancer generates a temple, wizard's tower, or castle:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the feature type as inspiration for the <strong>Title</strong></li>
                <li>The hex terrain informs the <strong>Address</strong> ("Deep in the forest," "At the mountain pass")</li>

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> BF&B creates "The Merchant Prince" (Power role) → Street Magic creates their headquarters: The Golden Scales Trading House, three-story building overlooking the harbor, smell of exotic spices and sound of ledgers snapping shut.</p>

    <h3>Key NPCs</h3>
    
    <p>Street Magic creates NPCs as <strong>Residents</strong>—characters associated with specific landmarks. This ties every important NPC to a location, making them easier to remember and giving players clear places to find them.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">When to Create Residents</div>
        <p><strong>Session Zero:</strong> 3-5 key NPCs (guild contacts, faction leaders, quest-givers)<br>
        <strong>During Play:</strong> When players ask "Who runs this place?" or you need a memorable NPC</p>
    </div>

    <h4>The Resident Procedure</h4>
    <p>Creating a resident takes <strong>5-10 minutes</strong> through collaborative vignettes. Each resident needs:</p>
    
    <div class="procedure">
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Title & Pronouns</h4>
            <p>What do people call them? Their common name and how they're referred to.</p>
            <p><em>Examples: The Lamplighter (she/her), Brother Moss (he/him), The Keeper (they/them), Sena Three-Coins (she/her)</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Affiliated Landmark</h4>
            <p>Every resident is tied to a specific landmark. Where do they work, live, or spend most of their time?</p>
            <p>This creates <strong>findability</strong>—players know where to go to interact with this NPC.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>True Name (via Collaborative Vignette)</h4>
            <p>The resident's true name is discovered through a <strong>short scene</strong> that shows them in their element.</p>
            
            <div class="callout tip">
                <div class="callout-title">Running a Collaborative Vignette</div>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>DM starts:</strong> "Let's see [Name] in their element. Where are they and what are they doing?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Players contribute:</strong> 
                        <ul>
                            <li>"I see them..." (appearance, gesture, expression)</li>
                            <li>"I hear..." (voice, ambient sounds, what they say)</li>
                            <li>"They're holding..." (objects, tools, possessions)</li>
                            <li>"I notice..." (habits, quirks, details)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Build together:</strong> Each contribution adds to the picture</li>
                    <li><strong>Stop when you have it:</strong> When you can <em>see</em> this person clearly, extract the true name</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p><strong>Example Vignette:</strong></p>
                <p><em>DM: "Let's see The Lamplighter. Where is she?"<br>
                Player 1: "She's on the corner of Saltmarket at dusk, lighting the street lamps one by one."<br>
                Player 2: "I see her hands are always smudged with lamp oil, and she hums old mining songs while she works."<br>
                DM: "She notices us watching and gives a gap-toothed smile, then moves to the next lamp without breaking her rhythm."<br>
                Player 3: "There's something hypnotic about the way she moves—like she's performed this ritual a thousand times."</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>True Name:</strong> "oil-smudged hands, hums mining songs, gap-toothed smile, moves like ritual"</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Speed Variant: Dictated Vignettes</h4>
    <p>If you need NPCs quickly, use <strong>dictated vignettes</strong> instead:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The DM (or player creating the resident) narrates the scene alone</li>
        <li>Takes 2-3 minutes instead of 5-10</li>
        <li>Still provides the same character glimpse</li>
        <li>Good for minor NPCs or when time is tight</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Quick NPC Creation</h4>
    <p>When you need an NPC <strong>immediately</strong> (mid-session):</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Title & Pronouns</strong> (30 seconds)</li>
        <li><strong>Skip the vignette</strong>—just pick one defining trait</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal True Name</strong> (1 minute): One sensory detail + one quirk</li>
        <li><strong>Note landmark</strong>: Where do they work/live?</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Example: Jorn the Smith (he/him), always sweating, never finishes sentences, works at the Forge Quarter</em></p>

    <h4>Faction Leaders as Residents</h4>
    <p>Each active faction should have at least one named leader. Use the resident procedure, but emphasize:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Their faction landmark:</strong> Where they hold court/meet followers</li>
        <li><strong>Their power level:</strong> Reflected in how others treat them during vignette</li>
        <li><strong>Their agenda:</strong> What they want for their faction (shows in their actions)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Integration with Other Systems</h4>
    
    <details>
        <summary><strong>With Beak, Feather, & Bone Roles</strong></summary>
        <div class="content-inner">
            <p>BF&B establishes <strong>11 community roles</strong> (Power, Protection, Prosperity, etc.). Use Street Magic to create the <strong>specific person</strong> filling that role:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BF&B:</strong> "Someone holds Power in this community"</li>
                <li><strong>Street Magic:</strong> Create the Merchant Prince as a Resident, give them a landmark (their trading house), run vignette to establish their true name</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </details>

    <details>
        <summary><strong>With Ex Novo Factions</strong></summary>
        <div class="content-inner">
            <p>Ex Novo creates abstract factions with power levels. Street Magic makes them <strong>concrete</strong>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each faction gets 1-2 named residents (leaders, key members)</li>
                <li>Residents affiliated with faction landmarks</li>
                <li>Power level reflected in their resources, influence, and treatment</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </details>

    <h4>Recording Residents</h4>
    <p>Each resident becomes a wiki page with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Title & Pronouns</strong></li>
        <li><strong>True Name</strong> (the key details from vignette)</li>
        <li><strong>Affiliated Landmark</strong> (where to find them)</li>
        <li><strong>Faction</strong> (if any)</li>
        <li><strong>Relationships</strong> (connections to other residents/factions)</li>
        <li><strong>Session Appearances</strong> (when players interacted with them)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Why This Works</div>
        <p>Collaborative vignettes make NPCs <strong>memorable</strong>. Players helped create them, so they're invested. The true name gives the DM easy recall during play. The landmark connection means players always know where to find them.</p>
    </div>
</section>

<section id="settlement-threats">
    <h3>Settlement Threats (Optional)</h3>
    
    <p>Some settlements have unique threats that emerge from faction actions. Unlike random encounters, these threats are <strong>consequences</strong> of political choices made during settlement creation.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Consequences, Not Random Encounters</div>
        <p>A settlement-specific threat isn't "there happens to be a dragon nearby." It's "The Miners dug too deep seeking profit, and awakened something they shouldn't have." The threat is <em>integrated</em> into the settlement's story—it exists <strong>because</strong> of faction choices, and resolving it will <strong>change</strong> the faction balance.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>When to Generate Settlement Threats</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Always:</strong> For session zero hometowns (creates immediate campaign hook)</li>
        <li><strong>Sometimes:</strong> For major settlements (adds regional danger)</li>
        <li><strong>Rarely:</strong> For minor settlements (not everything needs a threat)</li>
        <li><strong>On Request:</strong> When players want built-in adventure hook</li>
        <li><strong>From History:</strong> Historical events often create lingering threats</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Threat Generation Procedure</h4>
    <p>After defining factions and some historical events, identify which faction action attracted the threat:</p>

    <div class="procedure">
        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Step 1: Identify Catalyst Faction</h4>
            <p>Which faction has the most power or took the most dramatic action? That's your catalyst faction. Alternatively, look at historical events—did one create an obvious threat?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Step 2: Describe the Action</h4>
            <p>What specific thing did this faction do that caused the threat?</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Miners:</strong> Dug too deep, broke seals, disturbed ancient sites</li>
                <li><strong>Mages:</strong> Experiment went wrong, summoning failed, portal opened</li>
                <li><strong>Clerics:</strong> Ritual attracted entity, prophecy triggered, heresy punished</li>
                <li><strong>Merchants:</strong> Greed brought curse, artifact stolen, deal gone bad</li>
                <li><strong>Thieves:</strong> Wrong tomb opened, cursed item stolen, angered powers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="procedure-step">
            <h4>Step 3: Collaborative Threat Design</h4>
            <p>Everyone contributes one aspect of the resulting threat:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical appearance or form</li>
                <li>Behavior or movement pattern</li>
                <li>What it wants or needs</li>
                <li>Special ability or danger</li>
                <li>Weakness or vulnerability</li>
                <li>Connection to the inciting action</li>
                <li>Environmental effects or omens</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Example Threat: The Deepvein Horror</h4>
    <p><strong>Catalyst Faction:</strong> Miners Guild<br>
    <strong>Action:</strong> "Seeking rare crystals for profit, broke through into sealed chamber beneath mountains"<br>
    <strong>Historical Event:</strong> "Discovery of the Deepvein" (15 years ago) brought prosperity but awakened something</p>

    <p><strong>Threat Elements:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Appearance:</em> Stone elemental incorporating mined crystals into its body as armor</li>
        <li><em>Behavior:</em> Seeks to seal the breach and reclaim all stolen minerals</li>
        <li><em>Want:</em> Return of ore taken from the vault, closure of the mine</li>
        <li><em>Ability:</em> Causes earthquakes when angered, can sense its crystals</li>
        <li><em>Weakness:</em> Can be reasoned with if miners return what was taken (but they won't)</li>
        <li><em>Connection:</em> Each stolen crystal embedded in its body makes it stronger</li>
        <li><em>Effect:</em> Mine collapses are increasing, tremors felt in town</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Adventure Hooks:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Miners want it killed (protecting profits)</li>
        <li>Clerics want negotiation (respecting ancient guardian)</li>
        <li>Can party broker peace by returning crystals?</li>
        <li>What's in the sealed chamber?</li>
        <li>Other creatures awakening from disturbances</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Threat Scope & Resolution</h4>
    <p>Settlement threats don't need immediate resolution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Campaign Arc:</strong> Threat looms over multiple sessions (increasing pressure)</li>
        <li><strong>Background Danger:</strong> Consequences of ignoring it accumulate (more collapses, attacks)</li>
        <li><strong>Faction Shift:</strong> Resolving threat changes power balance (Miners lose influence if mine closes)</li>
        <li><strong>Regional Impact:</strong> Unresolved threats can spread to adjacent hexes</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Solutions:</strong> Combat is one option, but negotiation/appeasement/banishment also work</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Stat the Threat Separately</div>
        <p>The settlement generation process creates the <em>concept</em> of the threat. Use your system's monster creation rules to stat it when players actually engage with it. Scale to party level at that time.</p>
    </div>
