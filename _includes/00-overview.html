    <h3>What Is The Western Horizon?</h3>
    
    <p>The Western Horizon is a <strong>design philosophy</strong> for running West Marches campaigns where players drive the story through their goals, the GM generates content responsively, and the world is built collaboratively.</p>

    <p>Unlike traditional West Marches (where the GM pre-builds an entire world before play), WH generates content <strong>when players declare where they're going and why</strong>. Unlike traditional campaigns (where the GM plans storylines), WH lets <strong>stories emerge from player goals colliding with faction goals</strong>.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Core Insight</div>
        <p>If players bring goals and factions pursue goals, the GM doesn't need to author storylines. Create obstacles to player goals, let factions advance their own agendas, and story emerges naturally from the collision.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Who Is This For?</h3>

    <p>The Western Horizon is for GMs who want to run West Marches campaigns but:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Don't want heroic prep burdens</strong> - Generating an entire world upfront is exhausting</li>
        <li><strong>Want player agency to be real</strong> - Not just "which hook do you bite?"</li>
        <li><strong>Value emergent stories</strong> - Surprises for the GM too, not executed plans</li>
        <li><strong>Want sustainable long-term play</strong> - Campaigns that grow organically without GM burnout</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy collaborative worldbuilding</strong> - The world belongs to everyone at the table</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You don't need to be running a West Marches campaign to use these principles—goal-driven, responsive, collaborative play works in any campaign structure. But WH is specifically architected around the West Marches model: open table, player-organized sessions, persistent shared world, exploration-focused play.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">New to West Marches?</div>
        <p>West Marches is a campaign style invented by Ben Robbins featuring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open table:</strong> Variable player roster, no required attendance</li>
            <li><strong>Player-organized sessions:</strong> Players coordinate, pick their party, declare their goal</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent world:</strong> What one group discovers becomes canon for all</li>
            <li><strong>Exploration focus:</strong> The frontier is dangerous and largely unmapped</li>
            <li><strong>Guild structure:</strong> A central settlement where adventurers gather between expeditions</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>

    <p>To use The Western Horizon, you'll need:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>A TTRPG system</strong> - WH is system-agnostic, though examples use D&D 5E terminology</li>
        <li><strong>3-6 players minimum</strong> - West Marches works best with a larger pool (8-12+) but can run with fewer</li>
        <li><strong>A communication platform</strong> - Discord, forum, or similar for between-session coordination</li>
        <li><strong>A wiki or shared notes</strong> - Obsidian recommended, but any collaborative note tool works</li>
        <li><strong>Time between sessions</strong> - WH assumes days or weeks between sessions for prep and coordination</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Optional but recommended:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The worldbuilding games mentioned in Proven Solutions (Microscope, Ex Novo, etc.)</li>
        <li>Session recording and transcription tools (for AI-assisted wiki maintenance)</li>
        <li>Virtual tabletop if playing online (for map integration)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout warning">
        <div class="callout-title">This Is Not a Complete System</div>
        <p>The Western Horizon provides <strong>philosophy and procedures</strong> for campaign structure. It doesn't replace your TTRPG rules, nor does it include complete worldbuilding game procedures (you'll need those source books for full details).</p>
        <p>Think of WH as the <strong>architecture</strong> that shows how pieces fit together, not the pieces themselves.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>A Note on Terminology</h3>

    <p>Throughout this document:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>GM</strong> = Game Master, Dungeon Master, Referee, Facilitator (whatever your table calls it)</li>
        <li><strong>PC</strong> = Player Character (the adventurers)</li>
        <li><strong>Guild</strong> = The central settlement/organization where adventurers gather</li>
        <li><strong>Expedition</strong> = A single session's adventure arc (declaration → execution → return)</li>
        <li><strong>Faction</strong> = Any organized group with goals (guilds, cults, nations, families, etc.)</li>
        <li><strong>Canon</strong> = Established world facts that all players can reference</li>
        <li><strong>Generation</strong> = The process of creating new content (settlements, dungeons, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

<section id="philosophy">
    <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Fundamental Principle</div>
        <p>Content is generated <em>responsively</em> when players declare intent, not pre-generated in advance. Once established, it "always existed"—common knowledge available to all guild members.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Five Pillars of Western Horizon</h3>

    <h4>1. Goal-Driven Play</h4>
    <p>Players bring <strong>goals</strong>, not reactions to GM hooks. Each character has concrete objectives they're actively pursuing. The GM's job shifts from "create interesting hooks" to "create interesting obstacles to what players already want."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Players are invested because they authored their own direction</li>
        <li>Eliminates "what do we do?" paralysis at session start</li>
        <li>Provides clear criteria for content generation (what relates to player goals?)</li>
        <li>Creates natural story through goal collision between PCs and factions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Goals vs. Hooks</div>
        <p>Traditional play: GM creates hooks, players choose which to pursue. <strong>WH play:</strong> Players declare goals, GM creates obstacles to those goals. The inversion puts players in the driver's seat while still ensuring interesting challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>2. Responsive Generation</h4>
    <p>Content is created <strong>when needed, not before</strong>. When a player posts "I want to investigate the ruins in the Thornwood," that's when you generate the dungeon. When they reach a new tier and need a larger settlement, that's when you build the town.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eliminates wasted prep on content players never engage</li>
        <li>Reduces DM burnout from pre-building an entire world</li>
        <li>Ensures content is <em>responsive</em> to actual player interest</li>
        <li>Allows the campaign to grow organically in unexpected directions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">When Does "Responsive" Happen?</div>
        <p><strong>Not during the session.</strong> Responsive generation happens <strong>between sessions</strong> during prep. Player posts intent → GM generates content before session → Session runs with established content → Discoveries logged after session.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>3. Collaborative Authorship</h4>
    <p>The GM doesn't create the world alone. Players participate in worldbuilding at multiple stages:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Everyone builds history, sets tone, establishes the Guild</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement Building:</strong> Players help create towns, detail landmarks, define factions</li>
        <li><strong>Dungeon Rumors:</strong> Player speculation about dungeons informs their actual contents</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> When players find something, they help name it, describe it, define it</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Players are invested in content they helped create</li>
        <li>Reduces "guess what the GM wants" friction</li>
        <li>Creates surprising, emergent stories no one person could plan</li>
        <li>Distributes creative labor across the entire table</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Collaborative Principle</div>
        <p><em>"Everyone is equal. We each have vast power to create and destroy. But once we make something, it belongs to all of us. No one owns anything."</em></p>
        <p>This collaborative spirit extends beyond Session Zero into ongoing play. The world belongs to everyone at the table.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>The GM's Specialized Role</h5>
    <p>In collaborative authorship, the GM is still a storyteller—just no longer the <em>primary</em> author. Instead, the GM specializes in a particular kind of authorship: <strong>adjudication and simulation</strong>.</p>

        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The GM's authorship happens in <strong>three distinct modes</strong>:</p>

    <div class="authorship-modes">
        <div class="mode">
            <h6>1. Collaborative Creation (Between Sessions)</h6>
            <p><strong>With players:</strong> Running worldbuilding games, facilitating settlement creation, incorporating player ideas</p>
            <p><strong>Alone:</strong> Using generation systems to build content responsive to declared player goals</p>
            <p><em>This is where "what exists" gets authored.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="mode">
            <h6>2. Active Adjudication (During Session)</h6>
            <p><strong>The referee role:</strong> Making rulings on player actions within the established world</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Can I run up the wall anime-style?" → Judge based on character abilities and world physics</li>
                <li>"Does my brewing experience help here?" → Assess applicability and grant advantage/insight</li>
                <li>"What happens when I..." → Simulate authentic consequences</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>This is where "what happens" gets authored.</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="mode">
            <h6>3. World Simulation (After Session)</h6>
            <p><strong>The world reacts:</strong> Advancing faction clocks, simulating consequences, updating the state of the world</p>
            <p><em>This is where "what changes" gets authored.</em></p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout warning">
        <div class="callout-title">Two Types of "Reactive"</div>
        <p>The word "reactive" can mean two very different things in GMing. Understanding the difference is crucial to WH:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Content Reaction (Happens Between Sessions):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players declare: "We're going to the Thornwood Swamp"</li>
            <li>GM reacts by prepping that location</li>
            <li>This is <em>asynchronous</em>—happens before the session</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Adjudication Reaction (Happens During Session):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Players act: "I want to swing from that chandelier"</li>
            <li>GM reacts by ruling whether/how that works</li>
            <li>This is <em>synchronous</em>—happens in the moment</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Most traditional GMing advice addresses <em>content reaction during play</em> ("what if they go somewhere I didn't prep?"). WH eliminates that problem through self-contained expeditions. The GM still needs <em>adjudication skills</em>, but not <em>improvised content generation</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>The Self-Contained Expedition Structure</h5>
    <p>WH sessions follow a different structure than traditional RPG sessions. This structure is what enables collaborative authorship and eliminates the need for reactive content creation during play:</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Why "Self-Contained" Matters</div>
        <p>Traditional sessions often start with "What do you do?" and can go anywhere—the tavern, the market, across a random bridge. The GM must constantly react to unknown player direction.</p>
        <p><strong>WH sessions are different:</strong> They're going to the swamp. That's not "on the way to the swamp"—that's where they're going. You prepped the swamp because they told you they were going there. During the session, you're not surprised about <em>where</em> they are—only <em>what they do</em> when they get there.</p>
        <p>This is why advice like "stalling tactics" or "back-pocket encounters" doesn't apply to WH. Those solve problems that don't exist in self-contained expeditions.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>4. Canon Integration: "It Always Existed"</h4>
    <p>Once content is generated and played, it becomes <strong>permanent canon</strong> known to all guild members. The temple in the Thornwood? It always existed. The merchant prince who runs the harbor? Everyone knows about them.</p>

    <p><strong>How this works in practice:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content is added to the <strong>Guild Wiki</strong> (Obsidian or similar)</li>
        <li>Other players can reference it: "I heard there's a temple in the Thornwood..."</li>
        <li>Future generation must <strong>not contradict</strong> established canon</li>
        <li>New content <strong>builds on</strong> rather than replaces old content</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creates a <strong>persistent shared world</strong> that grows session by session</li>
        <li>Rewards long-term engagement—players see the consequences of their actions</li>
        <li>Enables cross-party continuity: "The Azure Company cleared those ruins last month"</li>
        <li>Removes "Schrödinger's dungeon" problem—things exist whether or not players visit them</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">What "Always Existed" Means</div>
        <p>It doesn't mean the DM secretly planned everything in advance. It means once something appears in play, we treat it as if it was always part of the world. The <strong>generation method</strong> is invisible to players—they just see a coherent, persistent world.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>5. Scale & Scope</h4>
    <p>A living world operates at multiple scales simultaneously. The Western Horizon needs generation procedures for each scale, from <strong>settlements that grow</strong> (village → town → city → capital) to <strong>content that deepens</strong> (region → location → room).</p>

    <p><strong>Why scale matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Scope matches stakes:</strong> Early adventures are local (bandit camps), later ones are regional (capital intrigue)</li>
        <li><strong>Content grows organically:</strong> Village → Town happens when characters reach the appropriate tier</li>
        <li><strong>Different procedures for different scales:</strong> Building a settlement requires different questions than detailing a tavern within it</li>
        <li><strong>Handoff points are clear:</strong> Settlement generation creates districts; location generation details buildings within those districts</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Problem-First, Not System-First</div>
        <p>Each scale has specific problems to solve. The Western Horizon defines <strong>what makes a good solution</strong> (collaborative, responsive, creates factions with goals, etc.) rather than mandating specific systems. Later sections present battle-tested procedures that align with these principles—but alternatives work too if they solve the same problems.</p>
    </div>

<section id="goals-not-hooks">
    <h2>But Why? Goals Over Hooks</h2>

    <p>If you've read the philosophy above and thought "this sounds nice, but how do players know what to pursue?"—this section is for you. It addresses the fundamental question that makes responsive generation actually work.</p>

    <div class="callout warning">
        <div class="callout-title">The Bootstrapping Problem</div>
        <p>Responsive generation requires player intent. But how can players form meaningful intent without knowing what exists? They can't want "the moss from the swamp" without knowing there's a swamp, and they won't know about the swamp without someone creating it first.</p>
        <p><strong>The traditional solution:</strong> The DM pre-generates content and offers it via hooks on a bulletin board.</p>
        <p><strong>The problem with that:</strong> It puts creative burden back on the DM and makes players passive consumers of GM-authored storylines.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>The Inversion: Players Bring Goals, Not Reactions</h3>

    <p>The solution comes from <em>The Game Master's Handbook of Proactive Roleplaying</em> by Jonah and Tristan Fishel. Instead of the GM creating hooks for players to react to, <strong>players arrive with goals and the GM creates obstacles</strong>.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Traditional (Reactive)</th>
                <th>Proactive</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>GM creates hooks</td>
                <td>Players declare goals</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Players choose from options</td>
                <td>GM creates obstacles to goals</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Here's what's available"</td>
                <td>"What do you want?"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Story comes to players</td>
                <td>Players pursue story</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GM plans the adventure</td>
                <td>Adventure emerges from goal collision</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>This isn't just philosophical—it's practical. When players bring goals, they've already done the work of creating investment and direction. The GM's job shifts from "invent interesting hooks" to "create interesting obstacles to what players already want."</p>

    <h3>What Makes a Good Goal?</h3>

    <p>Each player character should have <strong>three goals</strong> at any time (short-term, medium-term, long-term). Good goals have these properties:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Why It Matters</th>

            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">The Magic Question</div>
        <p>Ask players: <strong>"What would it look like when you reach your goal?"</strong></p>
        <p>This question helps players envision specific, achievable endpoints and often generates encounter ideas, NPC needs, and location requirements that feed directly into responsive generation.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Factions as the GM's Party</h3>

    <p>If players have goals, who provides opposition? <strong>Factions.</strong></p>

    <p>Every faction created through Ex Novo or Beak, Feather & Bone should have <strong>concrete goals</strong> that overlap or conflict with player goals. Factions become "the GM's party"—pursuing their own agendas between sessions, creating emergent pressure and obstacles.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Faction Element</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Identity</strong></td>
                <td>What they do, who they are</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Goals</strong></td>
                <td>What they want (specific, concrete)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Clocks</strong></td>
                <td>Progress toward goals (advances between sessions)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>NPCs</strong></td>
                <td>Agents who pursue faction goals in play</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>The key insight:</strong> Faction goals must relate to the same people, places, and events as PC goals. This ensures collision—and collision generates content.</p>

    <h3>Clocks: Between-Session Pressure</h3>

    <p>Borrowed from <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, <strong>clocks</strong> track faction progress toward goals:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>A clock is a circle divided into segments (typically 4 or 8)</li>
        <li>When a faction makes progress, fill a segment</li>
        <li>When full, the faction achieves their goal</li>
        <li>Clocks advance <strong>between sessions</strong>, whether players engage or not</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This creates urgency without the GM authoring storylines. The Merchant's Guild is 6/8 toward "monopolize the silk trade"—that's not a hook the GM invented, it's a consequence of faction activity. Players can engage with it or not, but the world keeps moving.</p>

    <h3>The Bulletin Board Reconsidered</h3>

    <p>In traditional West Marches, the bulletin board is the primary source of adventure hooks. In The Western Horizon, the bulletin board's role changes:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Traditional Role</th>
                <th>Proactive Role</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Primary source of adventures</td>
                <td>Supplement to player goals</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>GM-authored quest hooks</td>
                <td>Window into faction activity</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>"Choose your adventure"</td>
                <td>Information marketplace</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Required for play</td>
                <td>Fallback for players without direction</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The board becomes a place where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Factions post jobs</strong> that advance their goals (not the GM's storylines)</li>
        <li><strong>Rumors circulate</strong> that inform player goal pursuit</li>
        <li><strong>Consequences appear</strong> from faction clock advancement</li>
        <li><strong>Players without immediate goals</strong> can find direction</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Two Modes of Content Generation</h3>

    <p>This creates a two-tier system for content:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Mode</th>
                <th>Trigger</th>
                <th>Depth</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Hook Seeding</strong></td>
                <td>Faction clocks advance, session aftermath</td>
                <td>Shallow pointers</td>
                <td>"There's a swamp to the northwest"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Content Realization</strong></td>
                <td>Player pursues a goal</td>
                <td>Full generation</td>
                <td>The swamp's hexes, NPCs, dangers</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Hook seeding</strong> is proactive but shallow—it creates pointers without details. <strong>Content realization</strong> is responsive but deep—it fills in the details when players engage.</p>

    <h3>The Complete Picture</h3>

    <p>Putting it all together:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Players create characters with 3 goals each. Factions are created with goals. GM identifies overlaps and conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Between Sessions:</strong> Faction clocks advance. New rumors and consequences appear on the board. Players discuss goals and form intent.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Posts Intent:</strong> "I want to find the assassin who killed my mentor." This declares which goal they're pursuing.</li>
        <li><strong>DM Generates Content:</strong> Using the responsive generation systems, the DM creates obstacles: Where is the assassin? Who protects them? What faction goals intersect?</li>
        <li><strong>Session Runs:</strong> Play happens with generated content.</li>
        <li><strong>Aftermath:</strong> Discoveries become canon. Faction clocks advance. New goals emerge. Cycle repeats.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Why This Works</div>
        <p>Players bring investment (goals). Factions provide opposition (conflicting goals). The GM provides obstacles, not storylines. Story emerges from the collision of goals—surprising everyone, including the GM.</p>
        <p>As one commenter put it: <em>"This approach opens the door to what TTRPGs have always been about for me: a limitless, fully realized world where anything is possible."</em></p>

    <h3>How This Differs from Standard West Marches</h3>

    <p>Traditional West Marches assumes the DM <strong>pre-generates the entire world</strong> before play begins. The Western Horizon keeps the player-driven, open-table structure of West Marches but adds:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive content generation</strong> instead of upfront world creation</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative worldbuilding</strong> instead of DM-only world design</li>
        <li><strong>Goal-driven play</strong> instead of hook-driven play</li>
        <li><strong>Faction clocks</strong> for between-session pressure</li>
        <li><strong>System guidance</strong> for which procedures to use when</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with modern tools</strong> (Obsidian wikis, Claude AI processing)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">This Reduces DM Burden</div>
        <p>West Marches campaigns are notorious for DM burnout. By generating content responsively, collaboratively, and in response to player goals, The Western Horizon makes West Marches <strong>sustainable</strong> for long-term play without requiring heroic prep efforts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Guiding Principles for Collaborative Creation</h3>

    <p>These principles inform how we generate content at every scale:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Everyone is equal.</strong> One person might facilitate, but they don't have more control than others during collaborative creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't contradict what's already established.</strong> New content builds on the foundation—it doesn't erase it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't coach or suggest on someone else's turn.</strong> Let each person contribute their own ideas so we can be surprised.</li>
        <li><strong>Paint a clear picture everyone can visualize.</strong> Vague content is hard to build on—be specific and evocative.</li>
        <li><strong>Players are more important than the game.</strong> If something makes someone uncomfortable, address it immediately. Safety tools override all other rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What This Framework Provides</h3>

    <p>The Western Horizon gives you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> The "why" behind goal-driven, responsive, collaborative play</li>
        <li><strong>Problem definitions:</strong> Clear articulation of what needs solving at each scale</li>
        <li><strong>Solution criteria:</strong> What makes a good generation procedure for WH</li>
        <li><strong>Workflows:</strong> Player intent → content generation → session play → wiki documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Proven systems:</strong> Battle-tested procedures that align with WH principles</li>
        <li><strong>Integration points:</strong> How different scales hand off to each other</li>
        <li><strong>Goal and faction frameworks:</strong> Practical tools for proactive play</li>
        <li><strong>Templates:</strong> For wiki pages, session prep, and quick reference</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It does <strong>not</strong> prescribe mandatory systems. Think of this as <strong>design principles</strong> with proven examples, not a rigid playbook. Use what works for your table.</p>

<section id="proven-solutions">
    <h2>Proven Solutions</h2>

    <p>The Western Horizon doesn't prescribe specific systems—it defines problems and what makes good solutions. However, several <strong>battle-tested games</strong> align perfectly with WH principles. These systems have been refined through years of play and provide excellent starting points.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Why These Systems?</div>
        <p>Each system below was selected because it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Supports collaborative authorship</strong> - Players participate in creation</li>
            <li><strong>Generates responsive content</strong> - Works when players declare intent</li>
            <li><strong>Creates factions with goals</strong> - Opposition emerges naturally</li>
            <li><strong>Respects established canon</strong> - Builds on rather than contradicts</li>
            <li><strong>Operates at its scale efficiently</strong> - Solves the right-sized problems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use these systems as written, adapt them to your needs, or substitute alternatives that solve the same problems the same way.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">Reactive vs. Proactive Tables</div>
        <p>Many of these systems use random tables (roll 2d6, consult table, apply result). This might seem to contradict "responsive generation," but it doesn't. The <strong>design language</strong> works whether you roll randomly or choose deliberately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Roll:</strong> Quick generation, surprising results, good for areas players barely mentioned</li>
            <li><strong>Choose:</strong> Precise control, goal-aligned obstacles, better for player-declared destinations</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The tables provide <strong>design vocabulary</strong> either way. What matters is that content is generated <em>when players pursue goals</em>, not whether you rolled or picked.</p>
