    <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Fundamental Principle</div>
        <p>Content is generated <em>responsively</em> when players declare intent, not pre-generated in advance. Once established, it "always existed"—common knowledge available to all guild members.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Four Pillars of Western Horizon</h3>

    <h4>1. Responsive Generation</h4>
    <p>Content is created <strong>when needed, not before</strong>. When a player posts "I want to investigate the ruins in the Thornwood," that's when you run Ex Umbra to build the dungeon. When they reach a new tier and need a larger settlement, that's when you run Ex Novo.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Eliminates wasted prep on content players never engage</li>
        <li>Reduces DM burnout from pre-building an entire world</li>
        <li>Ensures content is <em>responsive</em> to actual player interest</li>
        <li>Allows the campaign to grow organically in unexpected directions</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">When Does "Responsive" Happen?</div>
        <p><strong>Not during the session.</strong> Responsive generation happens <strong>between sessions</strong> during prep. Player posts intent → DM generates content before session → Session runs with established content → Discoveries logged after session.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>2. Collaborative Authorship</h4>
    <p>The DM doesn't create the world alone. Players participate in worldbuilding through the generation systems themselves:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Zero:</strong> Everyone builds history (Microscope), sets tone (Palette), establishes the Guild</li>
        <li><strong>Settlement Sessions:</strong> Players help create towns using Ex Novo, detail buildings with Street Magic</li>
        <li><strong>Dungeon Prep:</strong> Rumors come from player speculation; Ex Umbra builds dungeons from those rumors</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> When players find something, they help name it, describe it, define it</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Players are invested in content they helped create</li>
        <li>Reduces "guess what the DM wants" friction</li>
        <li>Creates surprising, emergent stories no one person could plan</li>
        <li>Distributes creative labor across the entire table</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">From Microscope's Principles</div>
        <p><em>"Everyone is equal. We each have vast power to create and destroy. But once we make something, it belongs to all of us. No one owns anything."</em></p>
        <p>This collaborative spirit extends beyond Session Zero into ongoing play. The world belongs to everyone at the table.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>3. Canon Integration: "It Always Existed"</h4>
    <p>Once content is generated and played, it becomes <strong>permanent canon</strong> known to all guild members. The temple in the Thornwood? It always existed. The merchant prince who runs the harbor? Everyone knows about them.</p>

    <p><strong>How this works in practice:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content is added to the <strong>Guild Wiki</strong> (Obsidian or similar)</li>
        <li>Other players can reference it: "I heard there's a temple in the Thornwood..."</li>
        <li>Future generation must <strong>not contradict</strong> established canon</li>
        <li>New content <strong>builds on</strong> rather than replaces old content</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creates a <strong>persistent shared world</strong> that grows session by session</li>
        <li>Rewards long-term engagement—players see the consequences of their actions</li>
        <li>Enables cross-party continuity: "The Azure Company cleared those ruins last month"</li>
        <li>Removes "Schrödinger's dungeon" problem—things exist whether or not players visit them</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">What "Always Existed" Means</div>
        <p>It doesn't mean the DM secretly planned everything in advance. It means once something appears in play, we treat it as if it was always part of the world. The <strong>generation method</strong> is invisible to players—they just see a coherent, persistent world.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>4. System Synthesis by Scale</h4>
    <p>The Western Horizon doesn't invent new worldbuilding procedures—it <strong>combines existing excellent games</strong> and shows when to use which one:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Scale</th>
                <th>When to Use</th>
                <th>System</th>
                <th>Output</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>History</strong></td>
                <td>Session Zero, adding backstory</td>
                <td>Microscope, Chronicle</td>
                <td>Eras, events, legends</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Settlement</strong></td>
                <td>Reaching new tier, founding town</td>
                <td>Ex Novo, Kingdom</td>
                <td>Districts, factions, history</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Buildings</strong></td>
                <td>Detailing specific locations</td>
                <td>Beak Feather & Bone, Street Magic</td>
                <td>Landmarks, NPCs, sensory details</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Travel</strong></td>
                <td>Journey between quest sites</td>
                <td>Custom complications tables</td>
                <td>Waypoints, encounters, weather</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Dungeons</strong></td>
                <td>Player declares dungeon intent</td>
                <td>Ex Umbra, RISE</td>
                <td>Layouts, threats, treasures</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p><strong>Why this approach:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each system is <strong>best-in-class</strong> for its scale</li>
        <li>Clear <strong>handoff points</strong> between systems ("Ex Novo creates districts → Street Magic details buildings within them")</li>
        <li>Avoids reinventing the wheel—these games have been playtested extensively</li>
        <li>Modular—use the systems you like, adapt or skip the ones you don't</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How This Differs from Standard West Marches</h3>

    <p>Traditional West Marches assumes the DM <strong>pre-generates the entire world</strong> before play begins. The Western Horizon keeps the player-driven, open-table structure of West Marches but adds:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive content generation</strong> instead of upfront world creation</li>
        <li><strong>Collaborative worldbuilding</strong> instead of DM-only world design</li>
        <li><strong>System guidance</strong> for which procedures to use when</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with modern tools</strong> (Obsidian wikis, Claude AI processing)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">This Reduces DM Burden</div>
        <p>West Marches campaigns are notorious for DM burnout. By generating content responsively and collaboratively, The Western Horizon makes West Marches <strong>sustainable</strong> for long-term play without requiring heroic prep efforts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Guiding Principles from Source Games</h3>

    <p>These principles from Microscope inform how we use all the systems:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Everyone is equal.</strong> One person might facilitate, but they don't have more control than others during collaborative creation.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't contradict what's already established.</strong> New content builds on the foundation—it doesn't erase it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don't coach or suggest on someone else's turn.</strong> Let each person contribute their own ideas so we can be surprised.</li>
        <li><strong>Paint a clear picture everyone can visualize.</strong> Vague content is hard to build on—be specific and evocative.</li>
        <li><strong>Players are more important than the game.</strong> If something makes someone uncomfortable, address it immediately. Safety tools override all other rules.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What This Framework Provides</h3>

    <p>The Western Horizon gives you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Procedures</strong> for when and how to use each worldbuilding system</li>
        <li><strong>Workflows</strong> from player intent → content generation → session play → wiki documentation</li>
        <li><strong>Integration points</strong> showing how systems hand off to each other</li>
        <li><strong>Oracle tables</strong> unified from all sources for quick reference</li>
        <li><strong>Templates</strong> for wiki pages, session prep, and quick reference</li>
        <li><strong>Philosophy</strong> tying it all together into a coherent approach</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It does <strong>not</strong> replace the source games—you'll need those for complete procedures, tables, and examples. Think of this as the <strong>conductor's score</strong> showing when each instrument comes in, not the sheet music for each instrument.</p>
