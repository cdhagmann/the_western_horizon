    <h2>III. Beyond the Horizon — The Hex Map & Travel</h2>

    <p>In The Western Horizon, players declare <strong>destinations</strong> ("We're going to investigate the Thornwood Temple"), not directions. But the wilderness between destinations isn't empty space to fast-forward through—it's where future quests are discovered, intelligence is gathered, and characters leave their mark on the world.</p>

    <p>The hex map is the <strong>coordinate system</strong> that makes all of this work. It's not the gameplay—it's the shared notebook that tracks what's been found, where it was found, and who found it.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Hex Map as World Substrate</div>
        <p>A hex doesn't <em>contain</em> content—it provides <strong>coordinates</strong> for content. "There's a herb garden in hex 7" doesn't mean hex 7 is a herb garden. It means somewhere within that three-mile stretch, tucked along a creek bed, there's a patch of silvervein moss. The hex is how you reference it on the shared map so someone else can find it later.</p>
        <p>A single hex can hold multiple discoveries. The herb garden, a crumbling waymarker, a fox den—all in the same hex, all invisible to anyone whose goals don't make them relevant.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Three-Mile Hexes</h3>

    <p>Each hex on the local map is <strong>three miles wide</strong> (one league). This matters for two reasons:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Visibility:</strong> Three miles is roughly the distance to the horizon at ground level. While inside one hex, you can see the terrain and major features of adjacent hexes—enough to make informed decisions about where to go next.</li>
        <li><strong>Time:</strong> A road hex takes about an hour to cross. Wilderness hexes (forest, hills, swamp) take about four hours. This means you cross multiple hexes in a day and always feel like you're making progress.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>When to Zoom In vs. Montage</h4>
    <p><strong>Montage</strong> ("Three days pass uneventfully...") when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The destination is the focus</li>
        <li>Time is tight at the table</li>
        <li>Players are eager to get to the quest site</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Zoom In</strong> (play out travel scenes) when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You want to build tension or atmosphere</li>
        <li>You need to seed discoveries or future hooks</li>
        <li>A seeded encounter would enhance the story</li>
        <li>Players are low on resources (traveling is risky)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Seeded Discovery Pool</h3>

    <p>The Western Horizon doesn't use random encounter tables in the traditional sense. A truly random table—where any party might stumble onto anything—is anathema to goal-driven play. Instead, the GM maintains a <strong>seeded discovery pool</strong>: a short list of potential discoveries derived from the active roster's character dossiers.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">The Golden Rule</div>
        <p>If no player character has a goal related to herbalism, there is no secret herb garden. If no one cares about mines, there is no abandoned mineshaft with a shrine in it. The world shapes itself around <strong>who is playing in it</strong>. Content exists because a player's goals made it exist.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Building the Pool</h4>

    <p>Review the active roster's character dossiers. For each character's declared goals, seed one or two discoverable things into the local hex map:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Character Goal</th>
                <th>Seeded Discovery</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Herbalist seeking rare plants</td>
                <td>Silvervein moss along a creek bed in hex 7</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Priest looking for lost holy sites</td>
                <td>Collapsed shrine entrance in the hillside, hex 12</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cartographer mapping the frontier</td>
                <td>Ancient survey marker on a ridge, hex 4</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bounty hunter tracking a fugitive</td>
                <td>Abandoned campfire with distinctive boot prints, hex 9</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The pool stays small—tied to maybe 8–12 active player goals across the whole roster. That's your generation budget. Everything in the pool exists because someone at the table would care about finding it.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">The Dice Add Surprise, Not Randomness</div>
        <p>You can still roll to determine <em>when</em> and <em>where</em> a seeded discovery appears during travel. The randomness is in timing, not content. Sometimes the herb garden shows up when it's inconvenient, and that's <em>more</em> interesting than optimizing the perfect reveal.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Graceful Degradation</h4>
    <p>If a player drops out, their seeded content simply never gets discovered. It was always optional. Nobody misses what they never found. If a new player joins, review their dossier and add to the pool. The world reshapes around the current roster.</p>
</section>

<section id="wilderness-discoveries">
    <h3>Three Delivery Channels</h3>

    <p>Seeded discoveries reach players through three channels. The source is always the same—content exists because a player goal made it exist—but the delivery varies:</p>

    <h4>1. Self-Discovery During Travel</h4>
    <p>A party traveling to a quest site passes through or adjacent to a hex containing a seeded discovery. The GM describes what they notice: <em>"As you follow the creek through this stretch of woods, you spot clusters of silvervein moss growing thick along the banks."</em></p>

    <p>The party isn't meant to abandon their quest and investigate. They note it on the map and move on. The discovery enters the shared intelligence and becomes available for future quest intent.</p>

    <h4>2. Inter-Party Intelligence</h4>
    <p>Party A returns from a bandit-hunting expedition and reports what they saw along the way. The herb garden they passed through goes onto the <strong>shared tavern map</strong>—the community intelligence layer that all guild members can reference.</p>

    <p>Now the Herbalist has a reason to post quest intent: <em>"I want to investigate the herb garden Party A spotted near the Thornwood."</em> Nobody was railroaded. The GM didn't pitch it as a hook. The information economy did the work.</p>

    <h4>3. NPC Knowledge</h4>
    <p>The local apothecary says: <em>"If you're heading toward the Thornwood, keep an eye out—I've heard silvervein moss grows thick along the eastern creek beds."</em></p>

    <p>This works even without hex exploration. The apothecary isn't giving a quest hook—they're sharing <strong>knowledge natural to their role</strong>. Of course the apothecary knows where rare herbs grow. The information is diegetic.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Pick the Channel That Fits</div>
        <p>All three channels deliver the same seeded content. The GM picks whichever fits the moment. The player still decides whether to act on it. The content was generated responsively (you seeded the garden because an herbalist exists in the roster), discovered organically, and now drives <em>future</em> player-initiated action.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Travel Complications</h3>

        <p>Lookouts and high ground let characters see further than the standard one-hex horizon. From a watchtower or hilltop, reveal the terrain and visible features of hexes 2-3 rings out. This seeds more discoveries without requiring the party to physically enter those hexes, and gives players a reason to engage with the terrain tactically.</p>

    <h3>The Personal Hex Map & Tier Progression</h3>

    <p>Every character maintains their own hex map. A hex is "resolved" when it's no longer blank—when it has a <strong>memory</strong> attached to it. Passing through and mapping the terrain. Finding the herb garden. Fighting bandits on the road. Having a campfire conversation that changed everything. The hex is resolved in the sense that this character <em>lived something there</em>.</p>

    <div class="callout philosophy">
        <div class="callout-title">Resolved = Remembered</div>
        <p>A hex is resolved when it has a memory attached to it. Not when a quest is completed—when something <em>meaningful happened</em> to this character in this place.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Two Maps, Two Purposes</h4>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Map</th>
                <th>Purpose</th>
                <th>Who Fills It</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>The Shared Tavern Map</strong></td>
                <td>Intelligence layer—what's out there, who found it, where it is</td>
                <td>Everyone contributes; any guild member can reference it</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>Your Personal Map</strong></td>
                <td>Progression layer—what <em>you've</em> experienced, where <em>you've</em> been</td>
                <td>Only your character's own experiences count</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>The shared tavern map tells you what exists. Your personal map tracks what you've lived. The herb garden appearing on the tavern map is <strong>information</strong>. The herb garden appearing on <em>your</em> map means you went there and it meant something to you.</p>

    <h4>Progression Through Exploration</h4>

    <p>Tier advancement works like <strong>blackout bingo</strong>. As a character pursues their goals, travels to quest sites, makes discoveries, and lives through complications, their personal hex map fills in organically. When enough of the map has memories attached to it, that character has <strong>outgrown this frontier</strong>.</p>

    <p>This isn't about completing every quest or clearing every hex. Different characters fill different hexes—the herbalist's map looks nothing like the bounty hunter's. The map fills at each character's own pace, through their own experiences, regardless of what other players have done.</p>

    <div class="callout">
        <div class="callout-title">Outgrowing the Frontier</div>
        <p>Tier transition isn't about the village growing—it's about the character having <strong>exhausted what this place has to offer them</strong>. The herbalist found every garden within a day's travel. The priest consecrated the abandoned mines. The map is full of memories.</p>
        <p>What comes next is a choice: <strong>move on</strong> to a larger frontier with harder questions and a new blank map, or <strong>retire</strong>—your story in this place is complete.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Retirement as Fulfillment</h4>

    <p>Not every character arc ends with slaying a god. The herbalist who catalogued every plant in the valley and opened a shop—that's a complete story. The priest who built a shrine in the consecrated mine—done. They don't need a bigger map. They found what they were looking for.</p>

    <p>Retirement is <strong>fulfillment</strong>, not a power ceiling. Some players will push into the next tier. Others will look at their full hex map and say "my character is satisfied." Both are valid endings. The system supports both without one feeling lesser.</p>

    <p>This also keeps the roster fresh naturally. Characters cycle out because their stories conclude, not because they died or the campaign ended. New characters arrive with new goals, the seeded discovery pool reshapes around them, and the world regenerates.</p>

    <div class="callout tip">
        <div class="callout-title">New Characters, Fresh Maps</div>
        <p>A veteran player's new character starts with a <strong>blank personal map</strong> regardless of how explored the world feels to everyone else. The shared tavern map gives them intelligence about what's out there, but their progression is their own. No rushing, no inherited progress—50 players can join and leave at their own pace.</p>
    </div>

        <p>If your group prefers detailed hex-by-hex exploration where the journey <em>is</em> the primary content, see <strong>Appendix: Hexmancer Procedures</strong> for procedural terrain generation tables and feature placement rules. Most Western Horizon games use the destination-focused approach above as the default.</p>
